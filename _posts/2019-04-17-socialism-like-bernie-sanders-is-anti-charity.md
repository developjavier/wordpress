  Socialism, like Bernie Sanders, is
  anti-charity
author: Jessica Goldberg
post_excerpt: |
  Sanders, a longtime evangelist for a socialist ideology that has caused more human misery than any other idea in history, has never created a job.
  He works hard as a politician and there is real demand for him.
  His best-selling book, Our Revolution, pushed his income above $1 million in both 2016 and 2017.
  Another is that in 2016, his first million-dollar earning year, he donated less than 1% of his income to charity.
  But it would be wrong to label Bernie a hypocrite for giving so little to charity.
  Sanders, like other socialists, isn’t opposed to helping people.
  Americans are historically averse to socialism, and this helps explain their historical culture of giving generously to charity.
  Socialism is the enemy of charity because it outsources all compassion and altruism to the state.
  Socialists believe that all meaningful human interactions are political.
  It’s just that he is earnestly trying to create a perfect system where the government will come and take it away from him, for him.

<p>Sanders, a longtime evangelist for a socialist ideology that has caused more human misery than any other idea in history, has never created a job. He was even kicked off a hippy commune for refusing to work.</p>
<p>Still, give the man credit. He works hard as a politician and there is real demand for him. Unlike many of the politicians who have grown wealthy while in office, Sanders appears to have done it the honest way. His best-selling book, <i>Our Revolution,</i> pushed his income above $1 million in both 2016 and 2017. And assuming he followed Senate ethics rules and took no book advances, every penny of that had to be from actual sales.</p>
<p>That’s just one of the interesting pieces of information available in Sanders’ tax returns. Another is that in 2016, his first million-dollar earning year, he donated less than 1% of his income to charity.</p>
<p>It’s only fair to point out also that Sanders increased his giving to above 3% in 2017 and 2018 — perhaps because by then he had some inkling of a presidential contender.</p>
<p>But it would be wrong to label Bernie a hypocrite for giving so little to charity. Why?
