  ‘If I had known cancer was linked to
  implants, I would never have gotten
  them’

  Cook had chemotherapy and then surgery to remove the implants, followed by more chemotherapy.
  Even though BIA-ALCL is found in the breasts of some individuals with breast implants it is not specifically breast cancer.
  The link between textured breast implants and the disease was first reported in 1997.
  He said that 93 percent of women diagnosed and treated are disease-free after three years follow-up.
  Mark Sisco, chief of plastic surgery at NorthShore University HealthSystem, said that textured implants are used because they can be helpful to hold an implant in place and might reduce scar tissue for some women.
  The FDA has started a patient registry where cases of BIA-ALCL can be reported.
  Raylene Hollrah was 33 in 2008 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer.
  “I am 40 now and diagnosed with cancer twice,” Hollrah said.
  Both Sisco and Clemens said that women who have implants and are concerned about the possible BIA-ALCL connection should talk to their doctors.
  Reporting the facts for over 140 years.

<p>In 2016, Jennifer Cook, a California schoolteacher who had breast implants in 2010, noticed a change in one of her breasts. So when a school play she attended with her class had a line in it about breast cancer and implants, she got nervous.</p>
<p>After a quick online search turned up some scary stories, she got scanned and soon learned she had four masses around the implant — two of which were behind the implant, and therefore not palpable and not visible on a regular mammogram or ultrasound. She was diagnosed with something called breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma, or BIA-ALCL.</p>
<p>Cook had chemotherapy and then surgery to remove the implants, followed by more chemotherapy. She will be closely monitored for many years to make sure there is no recurrence of the cancer.</p>
<p>“If I had known cancer was linked to implants, I would never have gotten them,” Cook said.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/productsandmedicalprocedures/implantsandprosthetics/breastimplants/ucm239995.htm">BIA-ALCL</a> is a rare type of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, a cancer of the cells of the immune system. It can occur in different parts of the body, including the lymph nodes and skin. Even though BIA-ALCL is found in the breasts of some individuals with breast implants <a href="https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/ImplantsandProsthetics/BreastImplants/ucm241086.htm">it is not specifically breast cancer</a>.</p>
<p>The link between textured breast implants and the disease was first reported in 1997. Since then, about 457 cases have been reported to the Food and Drug Administration and nine people have died of it. (Worldwide, there has been a total of 600 cases and 17 deaths.) Last month an FDA advisory committee met to hear testimony about the safety of implants.</p>
<p>BIA-ALCL is considered treatable if found early enough, with surgery to remove the implants and any masses, and possibly chemotherapy or radiation if the disease has spread.</p>
<p>About 400,000 breast implants are done each year in the United States for post-cancer reconstruction and, much more often, breast enhancement reasons. Implants are either filled with silicone gel or saline solution; their surfaces are smooth or textured. According to Mark Clemens, associate professor of plastic surgery at MD Anderson Cancer Center, only about 12.7 percent of implants sold in the United States are textured, but worldwide the number is closer to 99 percent, although many countries have now banned the textured implants or are phasing them out.</p>
<p>Clemens said the vast majority of implant surgeons were unaware of the disease until January 2011 when the FDA first identified a possible association between textured implants and the development of BIA-ALCL.</p>
<p>“Our understanding is greatly advancing in just the last few years. Today, implant surgeons and oncologists are much more aware of this disease, which is important,” he said, but “we still are focusing on physician and public education on this as much as we can.”</p>
<p>Clemens said most cases can be treated with surgery alone, to...</p> <p class="article-info-more"> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/if-i-had-known-cancer-was-linked-to-implants-i-would-never-have-gotten-them/2019/04/12/3b83caa4-459c-11e9-90f0-0ccfeec87a61_story.html?noredirect=on" target="_blank">Click here to read more</a> </p>
