  Lost Frog Finally Returns Home After
  Five Years Missing
author: Jessica Goldberg
post_excerpt: |
  We’ll never know where she was for so many years, but a beloved family frog is finally back at home where she belongs, more than five years after disappearing from home.
  Five years ago, Sunny Windstorm let her dart frog mix, Cheech, outside her North Carolina home to potty.
  “I let her out to use the bathroom one morning.
  Oldberry explained that she’d found Cheech a year and a half earlier, on a leash, abandoned in a Hampton, Virginia parking lot.
  But, during a veterinary appointment last month, Oldberry remembered that the frog she’d been caring for more than a year might have a microchip.
  As fate would have it, a friend of Windstorm’s happened to be in Virginia that day and was happy to pick up Cheech and drive her back home only two days later.
  The family will never know where she lived or who cared for her before Oldberry found her in the parking lot.
  But, they’re just thrilled she’s finally back home after all these years.
  I don’t know where that frog has been or what she’s gone through, but I know she’s made a lot of people hoppy – I mean happy,” said Oldberry.
  Remember, in addition to posting signs and calling local animal shelters, if you find a lost frog, always visit a veterinarian or shelter to have the animal scanned for a microchip.

<p>Five years ago, Sunny Windstorm let her dart frog mix, Cheech, outside her North Carolina home to potty. That was the last time she and her family would see their beloved frog for another five years.</p>
<p>“I let her out to use the bathroom one morning. When I went to let her back in, I couldn’t find her. We drove around the neighborhood, we looked everywhere. We called neighbors. She never turned up,” Windstorm recalled to WITN. That was until last month when, out of the blue, Windstorm received a text message that simply read, “We found your frog Cheech.”</p>
<p>The text message came from Jody Oldberry, a frog lover in Virginia. Oldberry explained that she’d found Cheech a year and a half earlier, on a leash, abandoned in a Hampton, Virginia parking lot. Although she put up ‘found frog’ signs, made calls to animal control, and knocked on nearby doors, no one ever stepped forward to claim the frog. So, she decided to give her...</p> <p class="article-info-more"> <a href="https://www.dogingtonpost.com/lost-frog-finally-returns-home-after-five-years-missing/" target="_blank">Click here to read more</a> </p>
