  Whether you choose a cooling pad, mat or bed is not that important since all of them work on the same principles.

  Use a cooling pad to help your dog stay safe in the summer both indoors and outdoors.
  How to Choose a Good Dog Cooling Pad?
  To buy the best cooling pad for your dog, pay attention to these things: Size – Choose a cooling pad for dogs that will fit your individual pooch.
  If you plan to keep it in one place, water-filled beds or pads can be a good choice.
  However, they are not a good choice if you plan to move them a lot since they are usually very heavy.
  Also, choose materials that are safe and non-toxic to dogs, like nylon.
  It is important to provide our dogs with shade and water in the summer and relief from heat and UV rays.
  A cooling pad can be very helpful but if your home is hot and sunny, or your pup spends a lot of time outdoors in summer, the pad alone is not enough to keep your dog cool and safe.

<p><strong>We've moving into warmer weather</strong>, and keeping your dog cool during the hot spring or summer days can be difficult. Dog cooling pads are one of the easiest ways to ensure your pooch doesn't overheat indoors or outdoors. Whether you choose a cooling pad, mat or bed is not that important since all of them work on the same principles.</p>
<p><strong>But how does a cooling dog pad actually work?</strong></p>
<p>There are a few different types of <a href="https://topdogtips.com/best-dog-cooling-mat/">cooling pads/mats</a> that use different technologies to keep your pooch cool in hot weather. Some of these pads and mats are powered by <strong>electricity</strong>, while others use either <strong>water or gel</strong> to keep the dog cool for several hours.</p>
<p>Both water and gel-based cooling pads work by absorbing the excessive body heat and then dissipating it into the air. They don’t really feel cold or even cool when you touch them, but they are cooler than your dog’s body, which is enough.</p>
<p>The gel that you can find in many of these cooling pads is <strong>water-based with a polymer</strong>. Some of the pads are <strong>pressure-activated</strong>, which means that the gel is activated only when there is pressure and when there isn’t any pressure, the gel is able to recharge. Other pads are <strong>phase-activated</strong>, which means that they stay activated at certain temperatures.</p>
<p>The water-based dog cooling pads get filled with water that to keep the pet cool for a certain amount of time. However, the disadvantage of these pads is that they often leak or spill. They are not a good choice for dogs that are avid chewers. Whatever pad, bed or mat you choose, read the manual carefully and follow the instructions for use.</p>
