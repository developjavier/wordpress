  (NewsUSA) - Watching a new baby explore his or her world during those first few months can bring so much joy to motherhood.
  Those first three months, coined the "fourth trimester," present new challenges often to be figured out in a sleep-deprived state.
  Fashion solutions for new and expectant moms include: * Simplify: Steer clear of big prints, shiny fabrics, or anything that adds bulk.
  * Useful Nursing Apparel: For nursing or pumping moms, clothing that's easy to care for and comfortable is key.
  * Adjustable Apparel: Wrap tops are another popular choice for nursing moms.
  * Shapewear: Many new moms appreciate the comfort and support of seamless tops and compression leggings for their changing figures.
  Shapewear, such as zulily's popular Belly Bandit, offers support to the belly, waist, and hips. "Our maternity team saw the need to provide a special service to new moms who can be overwhelmed and strapped for time," explains Robin Otto, zulily maternity expert and merchandising manager.
  The Fourth-Trimester Closet Concierge is a unique service that connects moms directly with zulily's maternity style experts via the company's Facebook Messenger chat.
  Their experts address post-pregnancy fashion and style concerns, ranging from what to wear for special occasions, to the most flattering silhouettes for any woman's body type.
