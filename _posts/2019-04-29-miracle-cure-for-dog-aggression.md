post_title: Miracle Cure for Dog Aggression!
author: Jessica Goldberg
post_excerpt: |
  Essentially, it promised to stop dog aggression and reactivity “in minutes”.
  Not surprisingly, once the dog had been struck and startled, he stopped barking.
  The trouble is, whether on a television show, a Youtube video, or anywhere else, it’s all too easy to make it seem as though an aggression problem has been solved when in reality, the dog is simply suppressing the reactive behavior to avoid further pain.
  Does hitting or otherwise punishing a dog who is reactive to other dogs actually solve the problem?
  Well, I’m not stupid, so I learn quickly not to scream when you’re around.
  I’d have learned that spiders predict good things.
  This example of classical conditioning works similarly for dogs, although it is not, of course, the entire solution to helping a reactive dog.
  The vast majority of the time, behavior modification for serious issues such as fear or aggression is not a quick fix.

<p>I recently came across an online video that stopped me in my tracks. Essentially, it promised to stop dog aggression and reactivity “in minutes”. Naturally, I had to see this miracle for myself. Enter a trio of dogs who were barking reactively at passing dogs. The “trainer” struck the dog who was doing the most barking. Struck as in <em>hit</em> the dog with something that had been given a cutesy name but was actually a rolled up towel. The actual hitting was not shown, but rather, conveyed in text on the screen. (Apparently someone realized no one wants to see a dog being hit.) Not surprisingly, once the dog had been struck and startled, he stopped barking. Dogs are not stupid, and they understand how to behave in the moment in order to avoid being hit again. To be fair, there was mention of some training being done after this since the dogs were now calmer. And so, once again the other dogs were paraded past these dogs, who now remained silent. If you didn’t know any better you might be impressed, and might even believe that the problem had been solved. If you <em>did</em> know better, you’d notice the body language of the newly “trained” dogs, who were displaying subtle signs of anxiety and fear. The trouble is, whether on a television show, a Youtube video, or anywhere else, it’s all too easy to make it seem as though an aggression problem has been solved when in reality, the dog is simply suppressing the reactive behavior to avoid further pain.</p>
<p>Seeing a dog being being hit (or reading about it) gets all of our hackles up, and rightly so. But let’s take the emotion out of the situation for the moment and consider it logically. <em>Does</em> hitting or otherwise punishing a dog who is reactive to other dogs actually solve the problem? The majority of dogs who are classified as “aggressive” to others are actually displaying fear-based reactivity. They’re not comfortable with dogs in close proximity, so they bark and lunge...</p> <p class="article-info-more"> <a href="https://wildewmn.wordpress.com/2019/02/28/miracle-cure-for-dog-aggression/" target="_blank">Click here to read more</a> </p>
