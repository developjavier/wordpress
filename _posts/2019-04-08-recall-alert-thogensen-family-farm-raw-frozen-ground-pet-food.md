post_title: 'RECALL ALERT: Thogensen Family Farm Raw Frozen Ground Pet Food'
author: Jessica Goldberg
post_excerpt: |
  Thogensen Family Farm of Stanwood, WA is recalling raw frozen ground pet food because it has the potential to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes.
  The front of the package contains one large white square label with the company name, product type and weight.
  L. monocytogenes can affect animals eating the products and there is risk to humans from handling contaminated pet products, especially if they have not thoroughly washed their hands after having contact with the products or any surfaces exposed to these products.
  Pets with Listeria monocytogenes infections may be lethargic and have diarrhea or bloody diarrhea, fever, and vomiting.
  Infected but otherwise healthy pets can be carriers and infect other animals or humans.
  If your pet has consumed the recalled product and has these symptoms, please contact your veterinarian.
  Some of the product has not been distributed and held at the manufacturing location.
  No illnesses have been reported to date.
  The recall is the result of samples collected by the Washington State Department of Agriculture and revealed the finished products contained the bacteria.
  Consumers who have purchased affected product should discontinue use.
