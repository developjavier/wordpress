post_excerpt: |
  One in five deaths globally -- that's about 11 million people -- in 2017 occurred because of too much sodium and a lack of whole grains, fruit and nuts and seeds, the study found, rather than from diets packed with trans fats, sugar-sweetened drinks and high levels of red and processed meats.
  In fact, more than half of all global diet-related deaths in 2017 were due to just three risk factors: eating too much salt, not enough whole grains and not enough fruit.
  Diet-related deaths by country Ten million diet-related deaths in 2017 were from cardiovascular disease; cancer was responsible for 913,000 deaths, and Type 2 diabetes accounted for 339,000 deaths.
  Reynolds, who published a study in The Lancet on the effect of whole grains this year, cautions that many of the products sold to consumers today as "whole grain" often aren't. "Anyone who studies the history of food will tell you cultural preferences change over time," said Hawkes, who was not involved in the new study.
  In Mexico, the lack of nuts and seeds was the highest risk factor, followed by a lack of vegetables, whole grains, and fruit in the diet.
  And it was one of the few countries where unhealthy sugary beverages ranked quite high -- at No. "Unhealthy diet is the top risk factor for the Global Burden of Disease. "The public needs to be aware of the critical links between diet and health and demand public action to improve the access and availability of foods that contribute to healthy diets," Branca said. "Refining grains is highly profitable," Hawkes said.

<p>(CNN) -- Which risk factor is responsible for more deaths around the world than any other? Not smoking. Not even high blood pressure. It's a poor diet.</p>
<p>"In many countries, poor diet now causes more deaths than tobacco smoking and high blood pressure," said Ashkan Afshin, an assistant professor at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington.</p>
<p>And it's not just that people are choosing unhealthy options such as red meat and sugary sodas. Just as critical, said Afshin, <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.thelancet.com_journals_lancet_article_PIIS0140-2D6736-2819-2930041-2D8_fulltext&amp;d=DwIGaQ&amp;c=W8uiIUydLnv14aAum3Oieg&amp;r=eBiGgXECL5TyZF9gR9BlqdKJx8U4imeJ9qFasPBXfo8&amp;m=Tokpmv4wF9gq44u5CX4d1RWGQv4daSsRUlWnkJBmI40&amp;s=bEsmF8MrPtjsW4qCbi8HZNLqq1jEY2PaZxidq4gjEXI&amp;e=">the lead author of a 27-year global diet analysis published Wednesday in the journal the Lancet</a> , is the lack of healthy foods in our diets, along with high levels of salt.</p>
<p>"While traditionally all the conversation about healthy diet has been focused on lowering the intake of unhealthy food, in this study, we have shown that, at the population level, a low intake of healthy foods is the more important factor, rather than the high intake of unhealthy foods," he said.</p>
<p>One in five deaths globally -- that's about 11 million people -- in 2017 occurred because of too much sodium and a lack of whole grains, fruit and nuts and seeds, the study found, rather than from diets packed with trans fats, sugar-sweetened drinks and high levels of red and processed meats.</p>
<p>The large study size means these findings are relevant to everyone, no matter where they live, said Andrew Reynolds, a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Otago in New Zealand, who was not involved in the study.</p>
<p>"The findings of the paper will inform policy decisions that shape what food is available in Western countries, how it is marketed and potentially what it costs in the coming years," Reynolds said.</p>
<p><b>15 dietary risk factors</b></p>
<p>In the analysis, funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Afshin and his colleagues looked at 15 dietary risk factors and their impact on death and disability. High levels of unhealthy red and processed meats, sugar-sweetened beverages, trans fatty acids and salt -- all known to be health risks -- were compared with the effects of a diet low in many healthy foods. Those healthy items included fruits, vegetables, whole grains, milk, calcium, nuts and seeds, fiber, legumes or beans, omega-3 fatty acids from seafood, and polyunsaturated fats, the good-for-you fats found in salmon, vegetable oils and some nuts and seeds.</p>
<p>Except salt, which was a key risk factor in most countries, the study found red and processed meats, trans fats and sugary drinks toward the bottom of the risk chart for most countries.</p>
<p>In fact, more than half of all global diet-related deaths in 2017 were due to just three risk factors: eating too much salt, not enough whole grains and not enough fruit. Those risks held true regardless of socioeconomic level of most nations, Afshin said.</p>
<p>The new study is part of the <a href="http://www.healthdata.org/gbd">yearly Global Burden of Disease report,</a> prepared by a consortium of thousands of researchers that tracks premature death and disability from more than 350 diseases and injuries in 195 countries.</p>
<p>In January, the consortium released its " <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/16/health/new-diet-to-save-lives-and-planet-health-study-intl/index.html">diet for a healthy planet,</a> " which said that cutting red meat and sugar consumption in half and upping intake of fruits, vegetables and nuts could prevent up to 11.6 million premature deaths without harming the planet.</p>
<p>Afshin said an overview of the current study, but few of the details, was in last year's Global Burden of Disease report, making this year's version "the most comprehensive analysis on the health effects of diet ever conducted," despite some methodological flaws and gaps in data from underdeveloped countries.</p>
<p>"That's a good claim," Reynolds...</p> <p class="article-info-more"> <a href="https://www.wptv.com/news/national/what-we-arent-eating-is-killing-us-global-study-finds" target="_blank">Click here to read more</a> </p>
