  Pupford Freeze Dried Dog Training Treats are single ingredient treats made with only top-quality ingredients.
  Freeze dried treats are an excellent option, as long as you know what to look for.
  Most of these treats are made with a single ingredient: the protein source.
  Pupford Freeze Dried Dog Training Treats Review These dog treats are available in 2 flavors – beef liver and sweet potato.
  They are made with only beef liver and pea protein.
  Both varieties of Pupford Freeze Dried Dog Training Treats contain less than 2 kcals per treat.
  If you reward him with high calorie treats, he'll begin to gain unnecessary weight.
  I did notice that there are a lot of crumbs in the bottom of the bag.
  You can purchase a 4-ounce bag of the beef liver treats for $15.99 on Amazon right now, and the sweet potato flavor is $16.99 for a 4-ounce bag.
  Considering they are high-quality and there are more than 450 treats in the bag, they are a good value for the money.
