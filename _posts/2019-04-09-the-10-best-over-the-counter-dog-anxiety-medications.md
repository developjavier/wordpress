  I recommend talking with your veterinarian if you notice anxious behaviors in your dog and discussing which options may be best for their treatment.
  The SSRI type medications tend to take a while to build up in your dog’s system where Xanax and tranquilizers are more immediate, but all three medications influence your dog’s state of mind and behavior.
  What we loved best about the Shen Calmer, however, was that it had a calming effect on anxious behavior without the sedating effect that other more potent anxiety solutions have.
  I’d recommend trying Shen Calmer if you have an anxious dog who does not have a sensitive digestive system!
  We had been trusting Grizzly brand for years for Jet’s coat, skin, and joint supplementation, so it seemed a no-brainer to try their pellet formula with organic hemp.
  Why do I still recommend trying Rescue Remedy if you have a dog with anxiety if it didn’t work for us?
  I had been wanting to give organic hemp oil drops a try since my parents had recommended them after using them in their rescue dog.
  While we saw no relief of symptoms related to noise phobias and separation anxiety, I did find that the Snuggle Puppy was effective for Jet at night time with and without the heating pad.
  Warren London All-Natural Essential Oil Dog Calming Spray Warren London essential oil calming spray is a product that actually came out after Jet passed away, however, it used the same natural essential oils as we had used in an oil diffuser, so I wanted to include it in my recommendations because we did see results from these essential oils.

<p><strong>Being a dog parent to an anxious dog</strong> is hard work and finding an over the counter anxiety medication that is effective for your pooch is even harder. With a wealth of experience in the treatment of an anxious dog today, I’m going to share my personal experience with a handful of popular dog anxiety medication over the counter options.</p>
<p>You’ve heard me talk about my accident-prone black Labrador a time or two before. He was always an anxious, medical mess – the product of a puppy mill, but the most loyal dog you could ever hope to have and more. Dealing with his anxiety was difficult, though, and as he aged, it only got more so.</p>
<p>At the start of our dog's anxiety symptoms, we resolved to work on Jet’s behavioral patterns. We had experienced various unpleasant reactions to routine medications already and I was determined to avoid them for as long as possible.</p>
<p>It soon became apparent that Jet’s anxiety was really influencing his quality of life, so we talked with his vet about other solutions. We agreed to begin with over the counter dog anxiety medications, solutions and aids before prescription solutions to lessen the likelihood of unforeseen side effects.</p>

<h3><strong>What Options Are Available to Treat Canine Anxiety?</strong></h3>
<p>Your experience with canine anxiety may be similar to ours or it could be completely different, so what is best for your dog is not necessarily going to be what was best for us. I recommend talking with your veterinarian if you notice anxious behaviors in your dog and discussing which options may be best for their treatment.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Behavioral Modifications</strong></h3>
<p>Behavioral modifications were our first port of call for most behaviorally related concerns we ran into with Jet. Behavioral modification is exactly what it sounds like – changing patterns of behavior so that the outcome of those behaviors is different.</p>
<p>For example, Jet would become severely anxious when I left the house without him. So, I made a note of the things that would trigger him to become anxious – getting my keys, my coat, etc. I would then just keep my coat on or play with my keys without leaving the house. The idea was to desensitize Jet to the stimulus that kickstarted that anxiety. Once in a while, I would even go outside, close the door, and come back just a few minutes later with praise and treats in hand.</p>
<p>With perseverance, this type of canine behavioral modification is usually quite effective. However, for Jet, his anxiety was so severe and his quality of life was so influenced that I soon decided that we needed to add in a second treatment option to allow us time enough to focus on behavioral modification.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Over the Counter Dog Anxiety Medications</strong></h3>
<p>As I mentioned above, after talking with Jet’s vet, we decided to give over the counter anxiety solutions a try first and foremost because Jet had a history of being hypersensitive to just about every medication in the book.</p>
<p>We chose over the counter medications because they are generally safer than prescription medications with less significant side effects. Think of this like trying Benadryl versus going to the doctor for a steroid injection.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Prescription Medications</strong></h3>
<p>There are a variety of prescription medications available for canine anxiety, some of which have a lengthy history of use and others that are quite new on the market. These medications range from SSRI’s like Prozac to benzodiazepines like Xanax to a range of tranquilizers that do little more than knock your dog out so they aren’t conscious to feel symptoms of their anxiety.</p>
<p>The SSRI type medications tend to take a while to build up in your dog’s system where Xanax and tranquilizers are more immediate, but all three medications influence your dog’s state of mind and behavior.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, there are times when these types of interventions are the best option for a dog, but for us – with a dog whose fur all fell out at the application of flea and tick preventative – they didn’t seem like the best second line of defense.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Other Anxiety Treatments</strong></h3>
<p>In addition to behavioral interventions, over the counter medications, and prescription medications, there are other anxiety treatment aids available. Things like the Thunder Shirt or alternative <a href="https://topdogtips.com/best-dog-anxiety-vests/">anxiety vests</a>, the Soothing heartbeat puppy, pheromone pads and <a href="https://topdogtips.com/best-calming-collar-for-dogs/">calming collars</a>, etc.</p>
<p>We tried a few of these options when we sought a way to reduce Jet’s anxiety and I will include some of them in our dog anxiety medication over the counter list noted below because they were purchased over the counter as alternative treatment options and some proved to be quite useful.</p>
<h2><strong>Best Dog Anxiety Medications Over the Counter</strong></h2>
<p>Below are some of the better over the counter anxiety medications that we tried for canine anxiety and our experiences with each.</p>
<h3><strong>Shen Calmer</strong></h3>
<p>Shen Calmer was first recommended to us by a holistic veterinarian who had been recommending it for anxious pets for many years. Trusting his experience, we opted to give it a try too.</p>
<p>Shen Calmer is made from a blend of herbs that have been approved for use in cats and dogs. Although it’s not a particularly potent mixture of herbs, with regular use they build up in your pet’s system over time for a stronger effect.</p>
<p>What we really liked about Shen Calmer is that the active ingredients are veterinary trusted by holistic veterinarians and herbalists around the world. The capsule and tablet formulas are also both easy to slip into your dog’s daily diet. What we loved best about the Shen Calmer, however, was that it had a calming effect on anxious behavior without the sedating effect that other more potent anxiety solutions have.</p>
<p>While we found Shen Calmer to be beneficial when it came to taking the edge off (read: reducing symptoms but not eliminating them) in a severely anxious dog, there was one side effect that we could have lived without – GAS! We’re not talking about those cute little “toots”, we’re talking about full-blown toxic gas for a full 24 hours after taking.</p>
<p>There are multiple versions of Shen Calmer or Calm Shen available and in our experience, they all seem to be equally as effective. I’d recommend trying Shen Calmer if you have an anxious dog who does not have a sensitive digestive system!</p>
<h3><strong>Grizzly Organic Hemp Joint Health Mini Pellets for Dogs</strong></h3>
<p>Grizzly Organic Hemp Hip and Joint Health Mini Pellets for Dogs are a product that I came across by accident when shopping for our usual Grizzly Salmon Oil. We had been trusting Grizzly brand for years for Jet’s coat, skin, and joint supplementation, so it seemed a no-brainer to try their pellet formula with organic hemp.</p>
<p>Grizzly organic Hemp Hip and Joint Health Mini Pellets for Dogs are marketed as a joint supplement, however, they are equally as effective as other Grizzly organic hemp products when it comes to anxiety, so for an older dog, they’re a great solution. Plus, if you’re like me and trying to cut down on the number of unnecessary chemicals in your home, you’ll love that this supplement has the NASC (National Animal Support Counsel) seal of quality which essentially means it’s a safely produced and trusted supplement.</p>
<p>There are more than a few things that we loved about the Grizzly Joint Health supplement including the NASC certification. What made it especially appealing, though, was the fact that it addressed two problems at once so we could cut down on our daily supplements and the cost of those supplements while still making Jet feel comfortable. Best of all, though, is the simple fact that the product worked while being tiny enough to slip into food and not give Jet toxic gas as the Shen Calmer did!</p>
<p>There are various similar products available that combine hemp with fish oils, however, these products are NOT all created equal and we have yet to find one that matches up to Grizzly brand. I’d recommend this anxiety solution for dogs with all degrees of anxiety, although, it’s particularly helpful for older dogs who are in need of joint support as well.</p>
<h3><strong>Bach Rescue Remedy Pet Dropper<br></strong></h3>
<p>Bach Flower Rescue Remedy Natural Stress Reliever is a product I became familiar with through working with various rescue organizations. I had seen it work firsthand in dogs traveling with rescue convoys...</p> <p class="article-info-more"> <a href="https://topdogtips.com/best-dog-anxiety-medication-over-the-counter/" target="_blank">Click here to read more</a> </p>
