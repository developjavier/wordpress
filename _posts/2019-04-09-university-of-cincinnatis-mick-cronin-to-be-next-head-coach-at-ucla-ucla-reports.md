  CINCINNATI — University of Cincinnati men's basketball head coach Mick Cronin has agreed to become the next UCLA coach.
  “Coach Cronin informed me at noon ET today (Tuesday) about his decision to leave his position at the University of Cincinnati to take the head coaching job at UCLA,” UC Director of Athletics Mike Bohn said in a statement.
  We wish him well at UCLA.
  Despite losing AAC Player of the Year Gary Clark (Houston Rockets), Jacob Evans III (Golden State Warriors) and Kyle Washington (NBA G League), UC (28-7, 14-4 American Athletic Conference) won 13 of its last 16 conference games to finish second in the league during the regular season.
  Behind Jarron Cumberland, UC’s second AAC Player of the Year recipient in as many years, the Bearcats found ways to win, clawing out 11 victories by five points or less before claiming American Athletic Confefrence back-to-back league tournament titles for the first time since 1995 & 1996 with a win over No.
  UCLA (17-16, 9-9) was seventh in the Pac-12 this past season.
  Cronin's teams at Cincinnati rank as one of just two in the nation (along with Virginia) to be listed among the nation's top 25 in scoring defense each of the past seven seasons.
  Cronin, a former La Salle basketball standout, was inducted into the high school's hall of fame this past winter.
  Cronin was then a varsity assistant to Leon until 1996. "I joked with him and said if you get this one (the UCLA job) I might want to come with you," Leon said.

<p>CINCINNATI — University of Cincinnati men's basketball head coach Mick Cronin has agreed to become the next UCLA coach.</p>
<p>Cronin, a 1997 UC graduate and 1990 La Salle High School graduate, agreed to a six-year contract worth $24 million, according to the UCLA release. He will be introduced on Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>“Coach Cronin informed me at noon ET today (Tuesday) about his decision to leave his position at the University of Cincinnati to take the head coaching job at UCLA,” UC Director of Athletics Mike Bohn said in a statement. “We are thankful to Mick for his work over the past 13 seasons, elevating his alma mater into one of the elite programs in the nation. We wish him well at UCLA. We will begin moving forward immediately on a national search to find our next head coach.”</p>
<p>Cronin, who was the Bearcats head coach since 2006, compiled a 296-147 overall record in 13 seasons at the helm, guiding the Bearcats to nine consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances (2011-2019), two American Athletic Conference regular-season championships (2014, 2018) and two AAC tournament championships (2018, 2019). He was named the 2018 Sporting News Coach of the Year and 2014 AAC Coach of the Year.</p>
<p>While UC's vacancy will lead to plenty of speculation about the next head coach, 2019 Ohio Mr. Basketball winner <a href="https://gobearcats.com/news/2018/11/14/samari-curtis-signs-with-mens-basketball.aspx">Samari Curtis</a> plans to remain a Bearcat. The Xenia senior guard verbally committed to UC last summer and signed with the Bearcats in November.</p>
<p>“This is a top-tier basketball job for the right coach,” Bohn said. “With the $87-million investment in Fifth Third Arena, a consensus Top-25 team in the nation returning next season, nine-straight NCAA Tournaments and one of the Associated Press’ Top-10 programs of all time coupled with our strategic investments in student-athlete welfare and the incredible academic resources available at UC, we are confident about the upward trajectory of men’s basketball at UC.”</p>
<p>Cronin has become one of just six coaches in the nation to have led his program to the NCAA Tournament the last nine seasons. Joining him in that group are Mark Few (Gonzaga), Tom Izzo (Michigan State), Mike Krzyzewski (Duke), Bill Self (Kansas) and Roy Williams (North Carolina).</p>
<p>Cronin, 47, became the first Cincinnati coach to record back-to-back 30-win seasons in 2017 (30-6) and 2018 (31-5), including the 2017-18 campaign that saw the Bearcats tie the school mark for victories with 31 while finishing the year ranked sixth in the Associated Press poll.</p>
