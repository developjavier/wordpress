  You lick my face.
  But that’s ok. You amaze me by your dog hair spreading capacity.
  It is cunning that you get your hair into an unopened pack of butter.
  But I guess it’s a dog thing and you are a dog.
  About 50 times a day.
  Even if you leave them and the salon covered up in your hair.
  On estimate twenty times a day.
  But I love the heavy, warm, solid feel of your XL paws.
  You give me your unconditional love.
  And I give all of mine to you.

<p>You amaze me by your dog hair spreading capacity. It is cunning that you get your hair into an unopened pack of butter. Do you moonlight at the butter factory?</p>
<p>You steal food. But you should at least make sensible choices. You know very well that the outcome has not always been optimal. Not to mention the vet’s bills. Just saying.</p>
<p>Your nose is amazing. You can smell a pack of ham being opened several closed doors away. I have tested. Many times. Never fails.</p>
<p>You roll in substances that I do not want to have on you, on myself and most certainly not in the house. But I guess it’s a dog thing and you are a dog. So, I forgive you.</p>
<p>You bruise my feet and nearly knock me over just saying hello. About 50 times a day. Every day. But in a good way.</p>
