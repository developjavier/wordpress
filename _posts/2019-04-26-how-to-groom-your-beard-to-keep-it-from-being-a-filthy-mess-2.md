  How To Groom Your Beard To Keep It From
  Being A Filthy Mess

post_excerpt: |
  “We have normal organisms that live on our skin, and I think a misconception a lot of the time is that these organisms, including bacteria, are bad,” Dr. Forum Patel, a New York-based dermatologist, told HuffPost.
  Still, you need to wash your beard.
  “Men should be washing their beards as often as they wash their hair,” Patel told HuffPost.
  “They should be treating it just like the hair on their heads.” For example, she said, if someone sweats enough during a workout (or other activity) that they need to wash the hair on their head, “the same applies to your beard.” Mikka Gia, owner and head barber at The Groomed Society in Toronto, Canada, suggested washing a beard two to three times a week using a beard shampoo.
  After washing your beard, Gia suggested, apply a little bit of beard oil, as it “promotes hydration and adds shine and control.” The key is not applying too much, as it can lead to oil buildup on the hair and skin, which could lead to a greasy-feeling face, Gia said.
  ″You have a moist environment, and if you’re not really drying it after washing, that can harbor a lot of organisms, regardless of if they’re going to cause issues or not,” Patel said.
  “Sometimes that can get infected with the bacteria that live on our skin.” This point is more for the look of the beard than cleanliness, but Cruz noted that regular trims “are just as important as haircuts.” “Beard whiskers can split just like hairs on the head,” he said.
  Cruz and Gia agreed that long and short beards need to be washed and groomed.
  “Find a great barber who knows beards, face shapes and products,” Gia said.
  “Ask them to demonstrate how to wash and oil your beard.

<p>According to a recent study from the Hirslanden Clinic in Switzerland, men’s <a data-rapid_p="1" data-v9y="0" data-ylk="subsec:paragraph;g:5141f254-0647-3701-945a-6df4d2f8e8c5;itc:0;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link" href="https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/beard-men-germier-dogs_n_5cb63c2fe4b082aab08db5d3">beards carry more bacteria</a> ― some of which could be harmful to health ― than the hair of dogs.</p>
<p>Sounds pretty gross, right? Well, bearded men shouldn’t panic just yet. It should be noted that this particular study was <em>extremely</em> small and the sample groups weren’t equal; 18 men were tested versus 30 dogs. The researchers based their conclusion on the fact that every single man tested <a data-rapid_p="2" data-v9y="0" data-ylk="subsec:paragraph;itc:0;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/47939764">had high counts of bacteria</a> living in their beards, while only 23 of the dogs had the same levels. So while there were more dogs with high bacteria counts than men, percentage-wise, 100% of men had high counts compared with about 77% of the dogs.</p>

<p>The cleanliness of beards has long been a topic of debate, as people question things like <a data-rapid_p="3" data-v9y="0" data-ylk="subsec:paragraph;itc:0;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link" href="https://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/your-beard-does-not-contain-more-poo-toilet/">whether beards carry more traces of poop than a toilet</a>. For the record, it’s true that beards carry bacteria, but it’s not necessarily a cause for major concern.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean you should neglect taking care of your beard, though. In order to maintain a happy, healthy beard (and skin in the area), you need to put in a little bit of work. We spoke to grooming experts and a dermatologist to share their best beard tips. Read on to find out what they had to say.</p>
<p>“We have normal organisms that live on our skin, and I think a misconception a lot of the time is that these organisms, including bacteria, are bad,” Dr. Forum Patel, a New York-based dermatologist, told HuffPost.</p>
<p>In her opinion, it’s not necessarily accurate to say humans, or specifically their beards, are dirtier than dogs, “because we’re exposed to different environments.”</p>
<p>“We have a lot of bacteria that live on our skin,” she added. “But we need it there, it’s there for a reason.”</p>
<p>In fact, the bacteria that live on our skin are part of what’s called the skin’s <a data-rapid_p="4" data-v9y="0" data-ylk="subsec:paragraph;itc:0;cpos:16;pos:1;elm:context_link" href="https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/eczema/news/20180503/skins-good-bacteria-may-help-fight-eczema#1">microbiome</a>. Many of these bacteria have been found to be quite helpful; one study suggested they <a data-rapid_p="5" data-v9y="0" data-ylk="subsec:paragraph;itc:0;cpos:16;pos:2;elm:context_link" href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180301103701.htm">can help protect against cancer</a>, while another said that bacteria could help <a data-rapid_p="6" data-v9y="0" data-ylk="subsec:paragraph;itc:0;cpos:16;pos:3;elm:context_link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-00960-3">speed up the healing process</a>.</p>
<h3>Still, you need to wash your beard.</h3>
<p>This one might seem like a no-brainer, but washing your beard is important for getting unwanted germs out.</p>
<p>“Men should be washing their beards as often as they wash their hair,” Patel told HuffPost. “They should be treating it just like the hair on their heads.”</p>
<p>For example, she said, if someone sweats enough during a workout (or other activity) that they need to wash the hair on their head, “the same applies to your beard.”</p>
<p>Mikka Gia, owner and head barber at <a data-rapid_p="7" data-v9y="0" data-ylk="subsec:paragraph;itc:0;cpos:26;pos:1;elm:context_link" href="https://www.thegroomedsociety.com/">The Groomed Society</a> in Toronto, Canada, suggested washing a beard two to three times a week using a beard shampoo.</p>
<p>“Beard shampoos are generally milder than hair shampoo, as facial skin can be quite sensitive,” Gia said. “For convenience, there are beard shampoos or washes that are made for use on both the face and hair.”</p>
