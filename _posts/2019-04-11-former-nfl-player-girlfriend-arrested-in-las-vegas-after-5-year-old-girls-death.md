  LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) -- A former NFL player and his girlfriend have been arrested in connection with the death of a 5-year-old girl, according to a report by Fox News.
  Ex-NFL player, 28-year-old Cierre Wood, and his 25-year-old girlfriend, Amy Taylor, were taken into custody on Wednesday in connection with the death of Taylor's daughter, Las Vegas authorities said.
  Las Vegas Metro police said the pair was arrested at Summerlin Hospital after the child died there Tuesday night.
