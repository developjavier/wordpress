  WASHINGTON — Even as the White House claims vindication from the summary of special counsel Robert Mueller’s findings in the Russia probe, the American public does not see a clear verdict about whether President Donald Trump has been cleared of wrongdoing.
  But a third of Americans — 31 percent — say they’re not sure if Trump has been cleared.
  In February, Trump’s approval rating stood at 46 percent, but this month’s shift is within the poll’s margin of error.
  Warning signs for Trump for 2020 — and some Democratic presidential candidates, too While the poll did not find a significant shift in the president’s approval rating, it showed some continued weak spots as he prepares to run for re-election.
  A combined 58 percent of voters are either uncomfortable (37 percent) or have reservations about (21 percent) Bernie Sanders’ 2020 bid.
  For Joe Biden, who has yet to formally announce a presidential bid, a combined 47 percent are either enthusiastic (17 percent) or comfortable (30 percent) with him as a candidate, compared with 48 percent who say they’re either uncomfortable or have reservations.
  A combined 73 percent of Democrats say they’re either enthusiastic (33 percent) or comfortable (40 percent) with Biden as a candidate, while just 25 percent either have reservations (19 percent) or are uncomfortable (6 percent).
  For Warren, 23 percent of Democratic primary have reservations, and 10 percent are very uncomfortable.
  But a significant chunk of Democratic voters — about one in five — don’t know enough about those candidates to express an opinion.
  Among all Americans, 23 percent have a positive opinion of her, while 34 percent have a negative one.

<p class="article-info-author-source"> <span>Source: <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/poll-after-mueller-summary-americans-are-still-wait-see-mode-n989061" target="_blank">NBC News</a></span> </p> <p>WASHINGTON — Even as the White House claims vindication from the summary of special counsel Robert Mueller’s findings in the Russia probe, the American public does not see a clear verdict about whether President Donald Trump has been cleared of wrongdoing.</p>
<p>According to a new <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5784808-19093-NBCWSJ-March-Poll-3-31-19-Release.html">NBC News/ Wall Street Journal poll</a>, 29 percent of Americans say they believe Trump has been cleared of wrongdoing, based on what they have heard about Mueller’s findings, while 40 percent say they do not believe he has been cleared.</p>
<p>But a third of Americans — 31 percent — say they’re not sure if Trump has been cleared. That includes nearly half of independents (45 percent) and about a quarter of both Democrats (27 percent) and Republicans (25 percent.)</p>
<p>Respondents were asked about their views of the special counsel’s work on March 25-27, beginning the day after Attorney General William Barr released his summary of Mueller’s report that stated the probe “did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election.”</p>
<p>Barr also reported that Mueller declined to make a determination on whether Trump obstructed justice. The attorney general <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/barr-redacted-mueller-report-will-be-released-mid-april-if-n988961">informed Congress Friday</a> that more of Mueller's report will be released by mid-April.</p>
<p>"The public is still in a wait-and-see view of this investigation and what it means for Trump,” said Jeff Horwitt of the Democratic firm Hart Research, which conducted the poll along with Republican pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies.</p>
<p>Much of that ambiguity may be because less than half of the public says they have been deeply engaged with reporting about Barr’s summary of Mueller’s findings.</p>
<p>While a large majority of Americans — 78 percent — say they have heard about Mueller submitting his final report, only 39 percent say they have heard “a lot” about the story. That’s a smaller share of the population than those who said they had heard a lot about other significant stories in Trump’s political history, including his decision to fire James Comey (56 percent) or the release of the Access Hollywood videotape (66 percent).</p>
<p>“However substantial this event was in the Washington, D.C., community and maybe our political culture, it was not an event that captured the American public,” said McInturff.</p>
<p>The narrative about the Mueller probe has also not significantly affected the president’s approval rating, which stands at 43 percent. Fifty-three percent of Americans disapprove of his job performance.</p>
<p>In February, Trump’s approval rating stood at 46 percent, but this month’s shift is within the poll’s margin of error.</p>
<p>Since last month, fewer Americans now say that the Mueller probe has given them more doubts about Trump’s presidency. In the NBC/WSJ February poll, 48 percent of...</p> <p class="article-info-more"> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/poll-after-mueller-summary-americans-are-still-wait-see-mode-n989061" target="_blank">Click here to read more</a> </p>
