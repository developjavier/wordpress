  It all comes down to this.
  One game for the national title.
  Texas Tech and Virginia will meet Monday night in Minneapolis at the Final Four with the winner walking out with the school's first national championship.
  It will also be the first title for either Red Raiders coach Chris Beard or Cavaliers coach Tony Bennett.
  Defense should be the dominant theme of the evening with the Virginia and Texas Tech ranking first and third in the country respectively in scoring defense.
  The team that can find some semblance of an offense could have the upper hand and end up cutting down the nets.
  Our experts give their picks on the game.
