  Modern Dog Breeds Were Victorian
  Inventions

  Are some breeds more susceptible to rabies than others?
  Surprisingly, there was no history of the dogs in the “nation of dog lovers,” so it became my next research topic.
  In ‘The Invention of the Modern Dog: Breed and Blood in Victorian Britain’, which I co-wrote with Julie-Marie Strange and Neil Pemberton, we show that the momentous changes occurring in Victorian society directly impacted upon the nation’s dogs.
  Above all, they invented the idea of dog discrete breeds and then produced, by selection, cross-breeding and in-breeding, dogs to the physical standards they had defined.
  Secondly, the Victorians defined their physical standards (conformation) in terms of anatomical points breeds.
  The number of types of terrier increased and forms changed too, with some shrunk in size and others given exaggerated coats.
  Before the adoption of breeds defined by conformation, the types of dogs were like the colours on a rainbow: there were distinct types, but they varied within type and merged into each other at the margin.
  The practice was also due to breeders wanting dogs with pure blood, evidenced in pedigrees.
  However, breeders recognized that inbreeding could be taken too far, and many dogs were said show physical and mental weaknesses.
  The best-known example in the Victorian era was when Everett Millais crossed one of his degenerate basset hounds with a much larger bloodhound, and returned to the basset hound type, now with new blood, in just four generations.

<p class="article-info-author-source"> <span>Author: K9 Magazine</span>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<span>Source: <a href="http://www.k9magazine.com/modern-dog-breeds-were-victorian-inventions/" target="_blank">K9 Magazine</a></span> </p> <p>I am a historian of science and medicine who became interested in dogs through studying rabies in Britain in the century before it was eliminated in 1902.</p>
<p>Two questions were repeatedly asked by Victorians. Are some breeds more susceptible to rabies than others? Are pure bred, pedigree dogs more susceptible than mongrels and curs?</p>
<p>There were no clear-cut answers. Though much feared at the time, rabies and its human form hydrophobia occurred only sporadically, and records of the type of dogs were inconsistent, writes <em><strong>Michael Worboys</strong></em>.</p>
<p>What stuck with me was the number of different dog breeds recorded and what was said about them. When I looked what had been written on the topic, there was very little. There was vast literature on all things Victorian – except their dogs. Surprisingly, there was no history of the dogs in the “nation of dog lovers,” so it became my next research topic.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Invention-Modern-Dog-Victorian-Britain/dp/1421426587/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1543327446&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+invention+of+the+modern+dog">‘The Invention of the Modern Dog: Breed and Blood in Victorian Britain’</a>, which I co-wrote with Julie-Marie Strange and Neil Pemberton, we show that the momentous changes occurring in Victorian society directly impacted upon the nation’s dogs.</p>
<p>In other words, the Industrial Revolution co-existed with a Canine Revolution. You might have been surprised that we write about the modern dog’s “invention,” however, Victorian dog fanciers were more direct, often speaking of its “manufacture.”</p>
<p><strong>Why manufacture?</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, and in the spirit of the age, Victorians saw themselves as involved in the improvement of dogs. They celebrated the novelty of their new designs, their power to transform existing breeds, and even to resuscitate extinct breeds, as in George Graham’s controversial resuscitation of the Irish Wolfhound.</p>
<p>Above all, they invented the idea of dog discrete breeds and then produced, by selection, cross-breeding and in-breeding, dogs to the physical standards they had defined.</p>

<p>Secondly, the Victorians defined their physical standards (conformation) in terms of anatomical points breeds. This development was driven by conformation or fancy dog shows from the 1860s in their competitions to determine the best in each breed – the dog most closely matching the ideal.</p>
<p>There were disputes over judging, and particularly when a dog won a show in London one week, only to come last in Manchester the following week. Victorian dog owners believed national standards were needed (as with time introduced due to the railways in 1847) and national rules (as with football from 1863). The goal was, say, that Pointers across the country would increasingly conform to the breed standard (as nuts, bolts and screws with the Whitworth thread from 1841), leading to a more uniform breed population.</p>
