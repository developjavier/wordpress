  TOLEDO, Ohio — A 7-Eleven store owner was working in the back office when an employee alerted him to a possible shoplifter.
  Via the store's security cameras, Jitendra Singh watched as a teen slyly pocketed items such as gum and candy. "I asked him, 'Take out whatever you have in your pocket,' so he took out one of the items," Singh told CNN.
  When the store owner asked why he was stealing the merchandise, the teen said it was because he and his younger brother were hungry. "I said, 'Well that's not food.
  That's just something for munching,'" Singh said. "When he said, 'I'm hungry and that's why I'm stealing,' I said, 'OK, he has some genuine problem. "Once you go to jail, you'll have a criminal record later in life.
  Singh said he didn't expect his good deed to impact so many people. "Customers are now coming back and saying, 'You're a good guy and you did a good thing,'" Singh said.
