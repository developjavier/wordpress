  It’s always a dead giveaway that President Trump is on to something when the media start calling it “divisive.” That’s the Washington synonym for “politically effective.” It was "divisive" to call for a travel ban from several Muslim-majority countries known for harboring terrorists (60% support among registered voters).
  It was "divisive" to call out professional athletes for kneeling during the national anthem (58% of the public said athletes should be required to stand).
  The media want to pretend that Omar’s comments — she described the Muslim terrorists who two drove Boeing 767 airplanes into the World Trade Center as “some people did something” — never happened or were lacking a context that might have somehow made them more palpable.
  Speaking at an event hosted by the Council for American-Islamic Relations in late March, she said that Muslims “for far too long have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen” and that every Muslim “should be tired of it."
  She called on them to “raise hell” and “make people uncomfortable.” She offered no example of what made her or any other American Muslim being treated as second class.
  Omar's cheer that Muslims were the real victims of Sept. 11 caught the attention of conservatives on social media and then right-leaning news websites, as well as Fox News.
  This awakened her media protectors from their slumber.
  He invited Democratic activist Waleed Shahid on his "Reliable Sources" show to fault the “alt-right, far-right” for even having noticed the speech to begin with and say that the ultimate goal was “to defame and destroy the character of Ilhan Omar.” Trump last week tweeted out a video splicing Omar’s words with images of the twin towers engulfed in smoke from the air attacks.
  The Washington Post said that said Trump had gone “off topic,” because he wasn’t talking about the still-unpopular tax cut he passed with the Republican Congress in 2017.
  The media can only hope it goes away, or that people consider the “context."

<p>That’s the Washington synonym for “politically effective.”</p>
<p>It was "divisive" to call for a travel ban from several Muslim-majority countries known for harboring terrorists (<a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/07/05/trump-travel-ban-poll-voters-240215">60% support</a> among registered voters). It was "divisive" to propose that maybe immigration should be about bringing in people who will contribute to the country, rather than giving a green card anyone with family here (<a href="http://harvardharrispoll.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Final_HHP_20Feb2018_RegisteredVoters_Xtabs.pdf">84% support</a> among registered voters). It was "divisive" to call out professional athletes for kneeling during the national anthem (<a href="http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/FOOTBALL-POLL/010050ZQ28D/2017%20Reuters%20Tracking%20-%20NFL%20Topline%2009%2026%202017.pdf">58% of the public</a> said athletes should be required to stand).</p>
<p>I'm noticing a pattern here.</p>
<p>As Trump continued attacking Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., this week for her <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/ilhan-omar-call-your-office">flippant comment</a> about the Sept. 11 terror attacks, the Washington Post ran a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-focuses-on-divisive-messages-as-2020-reelection-bid-takes-shape/2019/04/15/423d9aa0-5f91-11e9-9ff2-abc984dc9eec_story.html?utm_term=.a16376715ebe">front-page story</a> Tuesday calling it a sign that Trump’s reelection campaign is “quickly taking shape around divisive messages centered on immigration and patriotism.” So, at least the Post is on the record defining patriotism as a “divisive” issue.</p>
<p>The media want to pretend that Omar’s comments — she described the Muslim terrorists who two drove Boeing 767 airplanes into the World Trade Center as “some people did something” — never happened or were lacking a context that might have somehow made them more palpable.</p>
<p>The context, in fact, is even more alarming. Speaking at an event hosted by the Council for American-Islamic Relations in late March, she said that Muslims “for far too long have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen” and that every Muslim “should be tired of it." She called on them to “raise hell” and “make people uncomfortable.”</p>
<p>She offered no example of what made her or any other American Muslim being treated as second class. She also said that a consequence of Sept. 11 was that “all of us [Muslims] were...</p> <p class="article-info-more"> <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/they-call-trumps-attacks-on-ilhan-omar-divisive-because-theyre-effective" target="_blank">Click here to read more</a> </p>
