post_title: Goodbye Willie
author: Jessica Goldberg
post_excerpt: |
  I can’t even find the perfect photo to include.
  But I will have lots to say, when the miasma of this pain has cleared.
  So, so much to say about life and death and dogs and the biological miracle that is our relationship with them.
  And about Willie.
  We are bereft, that’s all I can say now.
  Here is what I sent friends yesterday morning, on Monday the 15th of April, 2019.
  I’m including it here, because so many of you feel like friends, even though we’ve never met.
  His cancer has defied all expectations, and in spite of chemotherapy and a gazillion other efforts, has spread to his thorax.
  Thus, over the course of one day, Willie’s prognosis went from 4-6 months with chemo to “a few weeks” IF he is sedated and his chest cavity is drained every few days or so.
  We have, after agonized thought, decided that enough is enough.

<p><em>We wanted to let you know that we are putting Willie down tonight. His cancer has defied all expectations, and in spite of chemotherapy and a gazillion other efforts, has spread to his thorax. His chest had over 2 liters of fluid in it on Friday morning; that’s over a half a gallon. We had him sedated so that it could be drained to give him some relief, but it is...</em></p> <p class="article-info-more"> <a href="https://www.patriciamcconnell.com/theotherendoftheleash/goodbye-willie" target="_blank">Click here to read more</a> </p>
