post_title: 'Trump on if he’s had second thoughts about incendiary Ilhan Omar tweet: “No, not at all”'

  During a brief interview, Tom Hauser — a political reporter from KSTP TV, a local channel owned by Republican megadonor Stanley Hubbard — noted to Trump that his video tweet “has led to direct threats on [Omar’s] life.
  Any second thoughts about that tweet and the way it was produced and put together?” “No, not at all,” Trump replied.
  “Look, she’s been very disrespectful to this country.
  What it’s all about,” Trump said.
  I think she’s extremely unpatriotic and extremely disrespectful to our country.” REPORTER: Congresswoman Omar says your video led to direct threats on her life.
  TRUMP: "No, not at all."
  The latest controversy stems from comments she made more recently that some criticized as downplaying the 9/11 attacks, which she described as “some people did something.” On Sunday, Omar released a statement saying that “[s]ince the president’s tweet Friday evening, I have experienced an increase in direct threats on my life — many directly referencing or replying to the president’s video.
  Before departing for Minnesota on Tuesday, Trump posted yet another tweet accusing Omar of making “anti-Semitic, anti-Israel and ungrateful U.S.
  We will change it.” Trump again takes a shot at Somalis: "I want to reiterate something that is different from what we are talking about today, but I think you have been treated extremely unfairly with respect to immigration.

Ilhan Omar (D-MN) to the 9/11 attacks, President Donald Trump made it through a Tax Day business roundtable in the first-term Congress member home state on Monday without mentioning her. Afterward, however, Trump told a local reporter he had no regrets about his incendiary, misleading, and dangerous tweet — even though she’s faced <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/4/7/18299172/trump-ilhan-omar-anti-semitism-jewish-republicans">death threats from his supporters</a>.</p>

<p>“No, not at all,” Trump replied. He then went on to use a series of dog whistles about Omar, who in January became one of the country’s first Muslim congresswomen.</p>
<p>“Look, she’s been very disrespectful to this country. She’s been very disrespectful, frankly, to Israel. She is somebody that doesn’t really understand life, real life. What it’s all about,” Trump said. “It’s unfortunate. She’s got a way about her that’s very, very bad, I think, for our country. I think she’s extremely unpatriotic and extremely disrespectful to our country.”</p>

<p>Trump’s comments represent the latest in a series of rhetorical escalations against Omar since a fan of his was <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/4/7/18299172/trump-ilhan-omar-anti-semitism-jewish-republicans">arrested and charged with allegedly plotting to kill her</a> on April 6.</p>
<p>During a speech later that same day to the Republican Jewish Coalition, Trump gratuitously attacked Omar, saying “<a href="https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1114602898195873793">she doesn’t like Israel</a>.” Days later, he posted a tweet accusing Omar of “<a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1115648055603343360">assaulting Jews</a>.” Then last Friday, he posted the tweet aforementioned tweet featuring footage of...</p> <p class="article-info-more"> <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/4/16/18395065/trump-ilhan-omar-death-threats" target="_blank">Click here to read more</a> </p>
