  Researchers find 540 million more
  instances of exposed Facebook user data

post_excerpt: |
  The researchers from the firm UpGuard said in a blog post Wednesday that the data, which included user names and passwords, came from two different Facebook apps that stored their data publicly on Amazon’s cloud services.
  “These two situations speak to the inherent problem of mass information collection: the data doesn’t naturally go away, and a derelict storage location may or may not be given the attention it requires,” UpGuard said in its post.
  Facebook is again facing charges of housing discrimination because of its ad-targeting system, this time by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
  “For app developers on Facebook, part of the platform’s appeal is access to some slice of the data generated by and about Facebook users.
  The surface area for protecting the data of Facebook users is thus vast and heterogenous, and the responsibility for securing it lies with millions of app developers who have built on its platform.” The databases were from a Mexico-based media company called Cultura Colectiva, which included more than 540 million records — like user comments and likes — and from an app called At the Pool.
  The researchers said passwords stored for At the Pool were “presumably” for the app and not for Facebook.
  While the At the Pool data collection was not as large as that for Cultura Colectiva, UpGuard said it included plain text passwords for 22,000 users.
  Facebook will overhaul its ad-targeting systems to prevent discrimination in housing , credit and employment ads as part of a legal settlement.
  The discovery comes a little over a year after Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal , in which the data mining firm affiliated with Donald Trump got personal data on millions of Facebook users.
  “Data about Facebook users has been spread far beyond the bounds of what Facebook can control today.”

<p>Security researchers have uncovered more instances of Facebook user data being publicly exposed on the internet, further underscoring its struggles as it deals with a slew of privacy and other problems.</p>
<p>The researchers from the firm UpGuard said in a blog post Wednesday that the data, which included user names and passwords, came from two different Facebook apps that stored their data publicly on Amazon’s cloud services. Facebook said the databases have been taken down.</p>
<p>But the episode illustrates Facebook’s issues with controlling its users’ data, especially once it is in the hands of third-party developers.</p>
<p>“These two situations speak to the inherent problem of mass information collection: the data doesn’t naturally go away, and a derelict storage location may or may not be given the attention it requires,” <a href="https://www.upguard.com/breaches/facebook-user-data-leak">UpGuard said in its post</a>.</p>
