  ESPN’s Alex Rodriguez takes a shot at
  D.C. as a sports town
author: Jessica Goldberg
post_excerpt: |
  In his first of many appearances on ESPN’s “Sunday Night Baseball” as a member of the Phillies, Bryce Harper helped complete a season-opening sweep of the Atlanta Braves with his second home run in as many games.
  “You’ve seen him happy in D.C., you’ve seen him happy in his career, but there is something right now about Bryce, and he’s got 13 years here in Philadelphia,” ESPN analyst Jessica Mendoza said after Harper’s homer in the seventh inning.
  is about 130 miles down the road, but let’s make it clear, it’s a world of difference between markets,” Rodriguez said.
  “If you’re over there, you’re thinking about politics and what happens in the White House.
  If you’re here, this is a sports town and they looove their Phillies.” Questioning D.C.'s “sports town” credentials is nothing new — ESPN’s Michael Wilbon did it last year during the Capitals’ Stanley Cup run — but Rodriguez’s take is especially silly.
  This is the part where I could point out, as several fans who were irked by Rodriguez’s comments already have, that Washington has outdrawn the Phillies for five consecutive seasons.
  Nationals fans weren’t the only ones annoyed with Rodriguez on Sunday.
  “I’m excited,” Harper said on “SportsCenter” after the game.
  It’s part of going to a new place.
  I’m excited to get back in that ballpark, somewhere where I’m very comfortable and play a couple games.” Dear A-Rod — Real Washingtonians don’t spend all day thinking about politics.

Unlike on Opening Day, when at least a few fans at Citizens Bank Park booed Harper — perhaps sarcastically — following his second strikeout, he and the home crowd were all smiles on Sunday.</p>
<p>“You’ve seen him happy in D.C., you’ve seen him happy in his career, but there is something right now about Bryce, and he’s got 13 years here in Philadelphia,” ESPN analyst Jessica Mendoza said after Harper’s homer in the seventh inning. “Of course, a couple home runs in two days helps you a little bit.”</p>
<p>Fellow analyst Alex Rodriguez couldn’t resist taking an uninformed shot at D.C. as a sports town.</p>
<p>“D.C. is about 130 miles down the road, but let’s make it clear, it’s a world of difference between markets,” Rodriguez said. “If you’re over there, you’re thinking about politics and what happens in the White House. If you’re here, this is a sports town and they <i>looove</i> their Phillies.”</p>
<p>Questioning D.C.'s “sports town” credentials is nothing new — ESPN’s Michael Wilbon did it last year during the Capitals’ Stanley Cup run — but Rodriguez’s take is especially silly.</p>
