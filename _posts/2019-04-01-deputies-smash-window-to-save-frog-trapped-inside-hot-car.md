post_excerpt: |
  Two Florida deputies came to the rescue, smashing a window to rescue a distressed frog trapped inside a sweltering hot parked car.
  The outside temperature was 92-degrees when Escambia County Deputy Lily and Deputy Trainee Waters responded to a call about a frog locked in a hot car on March 12, around 1:00 in the afternoon.
  According to a local news channel, Deputy Lily broke the driver’s side window to rescue the amphibian.
  Waters gave the frog water and placed her in a cool patrol car until animal control arrived and took over.
  Police say the frog is recovering and will be just fine.
  The temperature inside a parked car on a warm day, even with the windows slightly open, can reach 160 degrees or above, causing potential brain damage, heatstroke, and death—all in a matter of minutes.
  As we approach summer, and on any warm day, leave your frogs safe at home.
