  House Judiciary plans vote this week to
  subpoena Mueller’s report

post_excerpt: |
  The House Judiciary Committee plans to vote Wednesday to authorize subpoenas to obtain the full report of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, escalating a feud with the Justice Department over a lengthy document detailing findings about Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.
  Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, on Monday announced plans for the panel’s vote, which would take place a day after a deadline the committee set for Attorney General William P. Barr to share the report.
  Barr pledged last week to release a redacted version by mid-April, well after Nadler’s deadline.
  [Democrats say they will accuse Barr of a ‘coverup’ if he delivers incomplete Mueller report] “As I have made clear, Congress requires the full and complete Special Counsel report, without redactions, as well as access to the underlying evidence,” Nadler said in a statement Monday, in which he urged Barr to reconsider meeting his Tuesday deadline, which Republicans have criticized as arbitrary.
  “The full and complete report must be released to Congress without delay.” Barr informed Congress on March 24 of Mueller’s main findings, writing in a four-page letter to the heads of the House and Senate Judiciary committees that the Mueller did not establish a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia to sway the election and offered no conclusion on whether the president sought to obstruct justice during the investigation.
  Show us the report,” she said.
  To this end, I have asked the Committee to authorize me to issue subpoenas, if necessary, to compel the production of documents and testimony.” In announcing plans for potential subpoenas, the Judiciary Committee pointed to several precedents in which the Justice Department had shared extensive material related to other investigations with Congress, including the probe of Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state.
  Committee aides said the timing of the issuance of any of the subpoenas authorized by the committee would be left up to Nadler.
  He also denies the public the transparency it deserves.
  We require the full report — the special counsel’s words, not the attorney general’s summary or a redacted version.” A must-read cheatsheet on the latest in politics that can be read in 5 minutes or less, every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
