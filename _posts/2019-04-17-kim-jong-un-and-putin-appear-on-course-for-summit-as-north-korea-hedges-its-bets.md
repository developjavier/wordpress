  Kim Jong Un and Putin appear on course
  for summit as North Korea hedges its
  bets

  The potential of closer ties between Putin and Kim carries historical resonance dating back to the countries’ Cold War bonds.
  But Moscow has bigger diplomatic priorities around the world, experts say, and is unlikely to disrupt U.S.-led efforts to pressure North North to unwind its nuclear program.
  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said this week that preparations were underway for a meeting, while Russian and South Korean newspapers said the pair may meet next week in Vladivostok, Russia’s Far East, as Putin makes his way to a summit on China’s Belt and Road initiative in Beijing.
  For Kim, a summit with Putin would be another step in the international rehabilitation of the once-ostracized leader.
  Last week, Kim gave the United States until the end of the year to fundamentally change its stance.
  He may also have been disappointed that South Korean President Moon Jae-in failed to secure any sanctions relief for North Korea when he visited Trump last week in Washington, experts said.
  Like Beijing, Moscow doesn’t want regime change in Pyongyang, which could destabilize the region and potentially bring a U.S.-friendly unified Korea up to its border.
  But it doesn’t want Pyongyang to become a nuclear-weapons state either.
  Since then, though, some Russian companies have covertly skirted the sanctions, principally through ship-to-ship oil transfers, experts say, and Moscow been pushing for sanctions to be eased.
  “The major policy is now made only in Pyongyang and Washington.

<p>TOKYO — Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un may finally be ready to meet for the first time, as Russia seeks to extend its influence and North Korea tries to hedge its bets after the failed summit with President Trump.</p>
<p>The potential of closer ties between Putin and Kim carries historical resonance dating back to the countries’ Cold War bonds. But Moscow has bigger diplomatic priorities around the world, experts say, and is unlikely to disrupt U.S.-led efforts to pressure North North to unwind its nuclear program.</p>
<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said this week that preparations were underway for a meeting, while Russian and South Korean newspapers said the pair may meet next week in Vladivostok, Russia’s Far East, as Putin makes his way to a summit on China’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/defiant-italy-becomes-the-first-g7-country-to-sign-on-to-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative/2019/03/22/54a732d4-4bdf-11e9-8cfc-2c5d0999c21e_story.html?utm_term=.1cef77b2286e">Belt and Road</a> initiative in Beijing.</p>
<p>In a sign of Moscow’s growing relevance, U.S. envoy Stephen Biegun is holding talks with Russian officials in Moscow on Wednesday and Thursday “to discuss efforts to advance the final, fully verified denuclearization of North Korea,” according to the <a href="https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2019/04/291149.htm">State Department</a>.</p>
<p>For Kim, a summit with Putin would be another step in the international rehabilitation of the once-ostracized leader. It would also be Kim’s chance to send a signal to both Washington and Beijing that he has other options.</p>
<p>For Putin, a summit would mark another milestone in his effort to show Russians — and the world — that he has brought his country back as a global diplomatic power.</p>
<p>“Russia wants to be the groom at every wedding and the dead man at every funeral,” said Georgy Kunadze, a retired Russian diplomat in East Asia.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t clear, he said, what Russia could deliver since it “will never vote on North Korea at the U.N. Security Council differently from the way China votes.”</p>
<p>There has been a flurry of diplomatic exchanges between the two countries of late. North Korea’s Vice Foreign Minister Im Chon Il visited Moscow last month, and Russian Interior Minister Vladimir Kolokoltsev was in Pyongyang in April.</p>
<p>Two Russian parliamentary delegations visited Pyongyang last month and this week, while there have been daily contacts between officials from the two sides in recent weeks, one diplomat said.</p>
<p>Andrei Lankov, a Russian North Korea expert at Seoul’s Kookmin University, said Russia wanted to become an important regional player but lacked the influence in either Washington or Pyongyang to really insert itself into the Korean diplomatic process.</p>
<p>“Russia can have some say in Pyongyang but only if it is going to...</p> <p class="article-info-more"> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/kim-jong-un-and-putin-appear-on-course-for-summit-as-north-korea-hedges-its-bets/2019/04/17/103654b2-60f8-11e9-87b8-3f2ec40cd81c_story.html?noredirect=on" target="_blank">Click here to read more</a> </p>
