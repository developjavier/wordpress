<p>Activity monitors have become a popular piece of technology in the human health field. Now, multiple companies are making activity monitors for pets. While the concept is slightly different, the results are the same. Products like the <strong>FitBark 2</strong> are helping pet owners keep their dogs healthy and happy.</p>
<p>Pet technology is always evolving, which helps us monitor our pets, take better care of them and prevent potential <a href="https://topdogtips.com/dog-health-symptoms-that-cannot-be-ignored/">health issues</a>. Dog activity trackers are exactly what they sound like – an electronic device that monitors your pet's level of activity.</p>
<p>They can provide insight about behavioral changes that may indicate your pet isn't feeling well. They also make it easy to share this information with your veterinarian.</p>
<p>How does the FitBark 2 device keep track of your dog's activity? What information does it give you? I've been using this tracker on our Labrador, Saddie, for more than a month now. In this review, I'll give you all the details about this tiny device and let you know what information I've learned about my canine companion.</p>
<h2><strong>FitBark 2 Dog Activity Monitor Review</strong></h2>
<p>The FitBark 2 activity monitor for dogs is very small. It measures about 1.5″ long and just .5″ wide. It weighs less than 1/3 ounce! Its small size makes this activity monitor perfect for any size dog.</p>
<p>I was worried about the durability of this tracker, because it is so small. Our dogs wrestle a lot, and they are quite active. After more than a month of daily use, our FitBark is showing no signs of wear.</p>
<p>The device is made of a durable high-impact polycarbonate. It's <a href="https://topdogtips.com/waterproof-dog-products-that-are-proven-to-work/">waterproof</a> and will operate in temperatures between -4˚F and 122˚F. This means the FitBark 2 Activity Tracker is suitable for every climate and environment.</p>
<p>It might be tiny, but the FitBark 2 can track your dog's:</p>
<ul>
<li>activity level</li>
<li>sleep quality</li>
<li>calories burned</li>
<li>distance traveled</li>
</ul>
<p>As you will see in my video review above, it provides a lot of information on your dog's overall health and well-being. The monitor tracks your pet 24/7, but it doesn't keep track of steps like human activity trackers. Instead, the FitBark 2 counts your dog's BarkPoints.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.fitbark.com/">FitBark website</a>, BarkPoints are “a proprietary point system that measures physical activity in line with best veterinary practices in terms of “activity counts” generated from 3D...</p> <p class="article-info-more"> <a href="https://topdogtips.com/fitbark-2-dog-activity-monitor-review/" target="_blank">Click here to read more</a> </p>
