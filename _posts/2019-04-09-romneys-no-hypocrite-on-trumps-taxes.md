post_excerpt: |
  With Russia collusion claims all but off the table as an impeachable offense against President Trump, Democrats have moved on to the next shiny thing.
  They have begun to chase his ever-elusive tax returns.
  No one buys his equivocation over auditing, and in a vacuum and an election against someone who's not Hillary Clinton, voters by default may have supremely cared whether a megalomaniac billionaire spent decades gaming the American tax code.
  But to say that the president should do something discretely differs from saying that Congress should make him do it with legislation.
  This is actually really simple.
  The following three things can all be true.
  Second, Romney has solidly opposed Trump on legal matters â€” voting, for example, to overturn his national emergency declaration.
  Third, Democrats' demand that the IRS release Trump's tax returns may very well violate existing law and precedent, preventing Congress from investigating individuals with no legislative purpose.
  For what it's worth, Trump's legal defense is fairly strong.
  Every president since Richard Nixon has released his tax returns, and Trump's refusal to do the same demonstrates a certain lack of care for accountability and transparency.

<p>In seeking the highest office of the free world, Trump ought to have released his tax returns in 2016, and he ought to do so again in 2020. No one buys his equivocation over auditing, and in a vacuum and an election against someone who's not Hillary Clinton, voters by default may have supremely cared whether a megalomaniac billionaire spent decades gaming the American tax code.</p>
<p>But to say that the president <i>should</i> do something discretely differs from saying that Congress should make him do it with legislation. It's a distinction lost on some members of media and the commentariat who are now going after Sen.
