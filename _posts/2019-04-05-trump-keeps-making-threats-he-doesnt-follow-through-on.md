  Consider a few examples.
  This policy change might be a good thing, as a border closure would damage U.S. businesses and consumers.
  Trump this week abandoned his earlier plan to introduce a new healthcare replacement bill for Obamacare.
  Trump added that if Maduro arrested Venezuela's interim President Juan Guaido, it would spark serious U.S. reprisals.
  Trump spent 2018 pushing Kim Jong Un toward negotiations.
  But in 2019, Trump has abandoned any hint of toughness.
  Instead, the president makes one-sided concessions to the North Korean leader.
  All in all, Trump is weakening his credibility by constantly proving that what he says he'll do isn't indicative of what he will do.
  Thus, what Trump says might or might not mean anything.
  This weakens Trump's ability to negotiate effectively with Democrats, but it also undermines his negotiations with regimes like that of China.

But to influence global actors, he must ensure that his words carry credibility. And unfortunately, he is making too many threats that he's not delivering on.</p>
<p>Consider a few examples.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, Trump was threatening to close down the border. Now Trump has abandoned that warning in favor of dangling <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/trump-drops-threat-to-close-border-gives-mexico-one-year-warning">tariffs</a> on Mexican car exports. This policy change might be a good thing, as a border closure would damage U.S. businesses and consumers. But Trump should never have made that threat in the first place, because now, as with his recent threat to shut down the government unless Democrats appropriated money for his border wall, Trump has proven himself a blinker.</p>
<p>Another recent example comes in the area of healthcare. Trump this week <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-says-no-obamacare-vote-until-after-2020-election">abandoned his earlier plan</a>...</p> <p class="article-info-more"> <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/trump-keeps-making-threats-he-doesnt-follow-through-on" target="_blank">Click here to read more</a> </p>
