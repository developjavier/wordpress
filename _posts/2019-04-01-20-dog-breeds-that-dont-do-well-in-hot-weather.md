  These dogs have extremely thick coats and it is important to keep them brushed out to reduce the risk of overheating.
  English Bulldog Brachycephalic dogs, which is a term used for dogs with a flat face, are extremely prone to heat stroke due to their narrow airways and nostrils.
  They also don’t do well in hot weather.
  Boxer Boxers are known for their high-energy levels and that might lead to overheating if they don’t stop running around to cool down and drink water.
  They also have a short muzzle which can lead to breathing problems.
  Shih Tzu This breed is not suitable for hot weather because it has both long hair and short nose, so they can overheat easily and get a heatstroke.

  However, that also means that they are not suitable companions in hot climates.
  It is best to keep this dog inside during the day in hot climates.

<p><strong>If you are thinking about adopting a dog</strong> and you live in an area where it’s often hot, especially near summer months, you should take into account that breed’s suitability for such hot living condition before making a choice. Even if you already have a dog, knowing how well they do when it’s hot can help you deal with it better. Here are 20 dog breeds that don’t do well in hot weather.</p>
<h2><strong>Alaskan Malamute</strong></h2>
<p>Alaskan Malamute is bred specifically to pull sleds in the Arctic, so hot weather is not exactly a suitable environment for this breed. These dogs have extremely thick coats and it is important to keep them brushed out to reduce the risk of overheating.</p>
<h2><strong>English Bulldog</strong></h2>
<p>Brachycephalic dogs, which is a term used for dogs with a flat face, are extremely prone to heat stroke due to their narrow airways and nostrils. One of those dogs is the English Bulldog. They often experience difficulties in hot weather because they can’t breathe properly when they overheat. A cooling vest or harness might help, but don’t walk your dog when it’s too hot anyway.</p>
<h2><strong>French Bulldog</strong></h2>
<p>The French cousins of the English Bulldog share the same problems. They also don’t do well in hot weather. In addition to their breathing problems, they are also high energy dogs which is a problem in hot weather because there is no way to spend that energy without overheating the dog. It’s best to keep them active indoors if you have air conditioning and walk them in early in the morning or late in the evening.</p>
<h2><strong>Pomeranian</strong></h2>
<p>Pomeranians have a double problem – they have a short muzzle and a thick coat. This is the recipe for overheating. Shaving their coat won’t help since it won’t reduce overheating and it may ruin their coat. Make sure that your pooch is well-hydrated in hot weather and keep their undercoat brushed.</p>
<h2><strong>Cavalier King Charles Spaniel</strong></h2>
<p>This breed is especially prone to obesity, which can make them prone to overheating, especially since they also have a short muzzle. It is important to keep your dog’s weight on a regular level and don’t let them outside when it’s too hot.</p>
<h2><strong>Chow Chow</strong></h2>
<p>Chow Chow is another breed with a very thick coat that has to be brushed regularly to allow the cool air to reach the dog’s skin. Don’t try to shave their coats in the summer because that only damages the coat and allows the sunrays to hit their skin directly.</p>
<h2><strong>Pug</strong></h2>
<p>Pug is prone to many health problems caused by their snub noses. Breathing troubles are especially common in pugs. They are also prone to obesity and that all makes them extremely...</p> <p class="article-info-more"> <a href="https://topdogtips.com/dog-breeds-bad-with-hot-weather/" target="_blank">Click here to read more</a> </p>
