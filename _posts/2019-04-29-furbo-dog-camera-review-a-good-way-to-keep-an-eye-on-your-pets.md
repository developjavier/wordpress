author: Jessica Goldberg
post_excerpt: |
  I couldn’t wait to try out the Furbo Dog Camera (on sale from 12th-23rd December) when K9 Magazine contacted me and asked us to review it for them.
  I downloaded the app, set the camera up and put it on the side in my living room.
  Then, it was time to leave for work and leave Bryan to his own devices with the Furbo Dog Camera watching.
  The first thing I noticed was how good the camera quality was when I checked in on Bryan with the app.
  The app allows you to take pictures from the live video, record the live video and also turn on the option of the bark sensor.
  The treats really fly out of the dispenser and Bryan is always very happy to find the treats across the living room floor throughout the day.
  It’s also great to interact with him and I love seeing him enjoying the treats that have been tossed.
  Conclusion: The Furbo Dog Camera Review Since having the Furbo camera, I also feel a lot more relaxed when I leave Bryan alone in the house because any time I start to worry about it, I can just open up the app on my phone and see where he is and that he's okay (he's normally sleeping in his bed).
  Overall, it’s safe to say Bryan and I are VERY impressed with the Furbo Dog Camera!
  Great quality product with loads of great features.

<p>Bryan and Ali joined our review team earlier this year and when we were given the chance to review the Furbo Dog Camera this month, we asked the duo to give us their thoughts on the pet treat camera.</p>
<p>Here's how they got on.</p>

<p>I am a big fan of keeping an eye on Bryan’s antics when I’m out, I've always been curious about what he actually gets up to when he’s unattended and it's good just to have the reassurance that everything is okay at home.</p>

<p>I previously bought a very basic dog camera when Bryan was a puppy, but I had stopped using it due to it not being easy to use and not working very well, with a very unclear picture too, so I was keen to see how the Furbo compared, having heard lots of good things. As well as the actual camera, I also couldn’t wait to try the treat dispenser.</p>
<h2>Unboxing the Furbo Dog Camera</h2>
<p>When the Furbo Dog Camera arrived, the packaging was very eye-catching. Lots of different pictures of dogs using the camera was already getting me excited to get it on and try it out!</p>
<p>Opening the box, I could see the camera and accessories, which looked great - including a UK and European plug socket, as well as a dog treats bag for us to be able to put the Furbo to the test using the right kind of treats. They also had the name 'Bryan' written on them, which was a lovely touch by Furbo for us.</p>
<p>I downloaded the app, set the camera up and put it on the side in my living room. The app even allows you to set up a profile of your dog and add a little profile picture of them.</p>
<p>Bryan was very interested in the camera at first, especially as he saw me pour some treats into the top of it, but soon forgot it was there...</p> <p class="article-info-more"> <a href="http://www.k9magazine.com/furbo-dog-camera-review/" target="_blank">Click here to read more</a> </p>
