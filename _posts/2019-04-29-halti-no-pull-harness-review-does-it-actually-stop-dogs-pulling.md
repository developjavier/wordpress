post_title: 'HALTI No-Pull Harness Review: Does It Actually Stop Dogs Pulling?'
author: Jessica Goldberg
post_excerpt: |
  It's very rare a product leaves me short of words, but the HALTI No-Pull Harness and its matching HALTI lead fall into that category.
  I own three dogs.
  So when we first got Chris and Danny, it was an adjustment.
  The HALTI No-Pull Harness & Double Ended Lead Review The harness (£18.81-22.99) is available in three sizes - small, medium and large.
  It's generally a very well made product and I love the padding around the leg hoops and mesh around the chest to make it comfortable and safe for dogs to use.
  One said they struggled to apply the harness because of how the leg hoops work and another said it can be inconvenient when putting on when your dog knows it's time to go out, so I'm not letting myself off the hook but perhaps it wasn't just me?
  When I walk the boys I tend to take them on my own for a long walk to get some fresh air and R&R just the two of us and we'll go to the park and play football too, so anything they use or wear has to be comfortable to them while they walk or run.
  The Halti No Pull harness works on the premise of 'squeezing and lifting' according to the team behind the product who say, "the harness tightens on the dog when they pull on the lead.
  Too long for me and most definitely too long for what I'd consider a short/road length as the instructions say it's suitable for and by having to turn the lead four or five times around my hand, it made it quite slippery.
  Final Thoughts on the HALTI No-Pull Harness & Double Ended Lead HALTI's products are well priced for the market, in fact, there are others a lot more expensive, so the cost alone might make them worth a try if you're considering whether you might benefit from extra control over a pulling dog, whatever their size or strength.

<p class="article-info-author-source"> <span>Author: Kim O'Meara</span>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<span>Source: <a href="http://www.k9magazine.com/halti-no-pull-harness-review-does-it-actually-stop-dogs-pulling/" target="_blank">K9 Magazine</a></span> </p> <p>It's very rare a product leaves me short of words, but the HALTI No-Pull Harness and its matching HALTI lead fall into that category. Not because they're necessarily bad, but not because they're necessarily good. More, I can't actually work them out.</p>
<p>Let me share why I wanted to review the no-pull harness in the first place and then I'll explain.</p>
<p>I own three dogs. Danny, a Rottweiler cross Dobermann and Chris and Mia, both Rottweilers. For years, I was spoilt by owning and walking just two girls - Mia and Chloe, a Labrador. As girls, even in their younger days, both walked very well and were quite laid back about it all.</p>
<p>So when we first got Chris and Danny, it was an adjustment. Mia, slowing down then (and even slower now) has never been a puller like I say, but Chris and Danny are now both adults, Chris is 4 and Danny is 5 or 6.</p>

<p><em>Chris</em></p>
<p>Both have been trained and are good boys, but they are strong. When we first leave home to go for a walk at our local park, we have to pass various streets to get there and as soon as I open the gate to leave, there's always about a minute of excitement where they forget their walking manners while I'm busy shutting the gate behind me.</p>

<p><em>Danny</em></p>
<p>It's understandable that they get excited - the smells, the lampposts and so on - and they recover themselves well because they know what they've been taught to do, but I always feel if I walk either dog on my own, I want to know that whatever happens, if another dog runs up from behind and spooks them, for example, that I have enough control of my own on top of this to stop them potentially pulling because of their strength.</p>
<p>It's mostly a preventative measure needed for short bursts so I feel happier, quite honestly, and a few months ago I asked to review the <a href="https://amzn.to/2ZRVGXU">HALTI No-Pull Harness</a>.</p>
<p>The HALTI brand is well established and has a good reputation so I thought I'd start off on the right foot and the team kindly offered to send us their same brand Double Ended Leads to review too.</p>

<h2>The HALTI No-Pull Harness & Double Ended Lead Review</h2>
<p>The <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2ZRVGXU">harness</a></strong> (£18.81-22.99) is available in three sizes - small, medium and large.</p>
<p>We received a medium for Danny and a large for Chris. Each arrived in a fuss-free box, easy to recycle with no unnecessary packaging - always a bonus. The leads arrived with a simple tag making them fuss-free too.</p>
<p>It's generally a very well made product and I love the padding around the leg hoops and mesh around the chest to make it comfortable and safe for dogs to use.</p>
<p>There are two hoops to clip your lead into - the first in the padded chest area and the second on top, which falls around the middle of your dog's back.</p>

<p>After unboxing, I wanted to work out how to use it so that I could put it on quickly when needed.</p>
<p>I only ever walk one dog at a time on my own so it's always a mission to get one out before the other two become aware of the other one's absence, so I thought by working the HALTI out, I could do that much easier.</p>

<p>After about 10 minutes, I gave the instructions to my husband and said 'you work it out'. He didn't really get them either and I was about to look for a Youtube video when I just happened to hold the harness in a particular way and the way it fell made it apparent how you are supposed to place it around the dog's legs.</p>
<p>The problem I was having was that looking at the instructions and photo on the front of the box, you...</p> <p class="article-info-more"> <a href="http://www.k9magazine.com/halti-no-pull-harness-review-does-it-actually-stop-dogs-pulling/" target="_blank">Click here to read more</a> </p>
