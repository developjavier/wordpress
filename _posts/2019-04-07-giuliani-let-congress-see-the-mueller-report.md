post_title: 'Giuliani: Let Congress see the Mueller report'
author: Jessica Goldberg
post_excerpt: |
  Rudy Giuliani wants the full Mueller report to go to Congress — because "believe me, there was nothing there."
  Trump, though, has repeatedly derided the probe as a partisan witch hunt and celebrated when Attorney General William Barr said in his summary of Mueller's findings that the special counsel could not conclude the president committed any crimes.
  Barr, meanwhile, has said he's tied up on how much information he can release, arguing grand jury testimony and ongoing investigations must remain secret.
  Though Giuliani said he wants Democrats to get the full report, he continued to attack them Sunday, calling their continued suspicions against the president unfounded. "Does he want us to believe that he's going to give us a fair hearing?"
  Giuliani asked.
  Asked what he had against Nadler's call to have some members of the special counsel's team testify before the committee, Giuliani bristled.
  For a political show?
  Giuliani said. "Can we listen to the report first?"

<p>Rudy Giuliani wants the full Mueller report to go to Congress — because "believe me, there was nothing there."</p>
<p>Appearing on CBS' "Face the Nation" Sunday, the former New York mayor who is one of President Donald Trump's personal lawyers, argued the president has nothing to hide and has demonstrated "unprecedented" cooperation with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.</p>
<p>Trump, though, has repeatedly derided the probe as a partisan witch hunt and celebrated when Attorney General William Barr said in his summary of Mueller's findings that the special counsel could not conclude the president committed any crimes.</p>
