  Working with people who have intellectual and developmental disabilities, like Down syndrome or autism, can be complex and challenging even for those with years of training.
  The deputies said Ethan was asked to leave before they took him by the arms.
  Ever since, Patti Saylor has been fighting to change the way law enforcement personnel are trained when encountering people like Ethan. "We know something the police don't know," Patti Saylor says. "It's not always resistance" Ethan Saylor's death highlighted the lack of training many law enforcement officers have when it comes to people with intellectual or developmental disabilities. "Different tools to use on the street" Six years after Ethan Saylor's death, Maryland has become a leader among states in requiring police training on how to respond to people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. "If we can provide a different perspective and give them different tools to use on the street, I just think that's great," says Percy Alston, the director of the college's Public Safety and Security Institute.
  Alston is responsible for training new and experienced police officers on how responding to people with these disabilities might be different than what officers are used to.
  But there are people with certain disabilities that do like to touch," Alston explains. "So many police officers have asked me, what should they have done?

<p>Working with people who have intellectual and developmental disabilities, like Down syndrome or autism, can be complex and challenging even for those with years of training. But one group — law enforcement — often encounters people with these conditions in high-stress situations, with little or no training at all.</p>
<p>Patti Saylor knows all too well what the consequences of that can be.</p>
<p>Her son Ethan, who had Down syndrome, died after an encounter with law enforcement when he was 26. It's a tragedy she believes could have been prevented.</p>
<p>In January 2013, Ethan went to see the movie <em>Zero Dark Thirty</em> at a mall in Frederick County, Md. Afterward, when his support aide went to get the car, Ethan went back inside to try to see the movie a second time, but he didn't buy a new ticket.</p>
<p>Three off-duty sheriff's deputies, who were working as security guards, confronted him.</p>
<p>"He didn't cooperate, of course," Patti Saylor says. "He didn't want to leave. At that point, I believe, he wouldn't know what was going on."</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-mdd-1_13-cv-03089/pdf/USCOURTS-mdd-1_13-cv-03089-0.pdf">civil lawsuit</a> filed by Ethan's parents, the deputies "tried to drag him from the theater," and Ethan "ended up on the floor with at least one deputy on top of him." The deputies said Ethan was asked to leave before they took him by the arms. They denied any wrongdoing in the case, which <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/settlement-reached-in-police-custody-death-of-man-with-down-syndrome/2018/04/24/7d53c0ca-47fe-11e8-827e-190efaf1f1ee_story.html?utm_term=.3e08da33f1c7">reached a settlement last year</a>.</p>
<p>There on the floor of the movie theater, Ethan stopped breathing. He was later pronounced dead at a local hospital. His death, from asphyxia, was ruled <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/judge-orders-civil-trial-in-police-custody-death-of-26-year-old-with-down-syndrome/2016/09/09/4d5ba96c-76ce-11e6-b786-19d0cb1ed06c_story.html?utm_term=.d7a66ed80de7">a homicide</a>. A Frederick County grand jury cleared the deputies of criminal charges.</p>
<p>Ever since, Patti Saylor has been fighting to change the way law enforcement personnel are trained when encountering people like Ethan. She says families like hers — with firsthand knowledge — have a unique perspective.</p>
<p>"We know something the police don't know," Patti Saylor says. "I felt like we needed to teach them, and then hold them accountable."</p>

<p><strong>"It's not always resistance"</strong></p>
<p>Ethan Saylor's death highlighted the lack of training many law enforcement officers have when it comes to people with intellectual or developmental disabilities.</p>
<p>Instead, much of their training revolves around how to <a href="https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/slleta13.pdf">gain and maintain control</a> of a situation. Police training programs nationwide spend, on average, 168 hours teaching officers about use of force, weapons and defensive tactics, according to the most recent statistics from the Justice Department. That compares with only 10 hours spent on mental illness, for example. For that report, the government did not track the training...</p> <p class="article-info-more"> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/705887493/how-one-mothers-battle-is-changing-police-training-on-disabilities" target="_blank">Click here to read more</a> </p>
