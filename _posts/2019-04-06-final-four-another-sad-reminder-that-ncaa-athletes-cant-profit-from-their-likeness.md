post_title: 'Final Four another sad reminder that NCAA athletes can&#8217;t profit from their likeness'
author: Jessica Goldberg
post_excerpt: |
  Each year, March Madness is the NCAA’s biggest event from a revenue standpoint.
  There is an interesting case to be made for paying elite NCAA athletes, but here is what is even more clear: They should at least be able to profit from their likeness.
  For many of the athletes competing in the Final Four this weekend, this will be the peak of their athletic careers.
  If the interest is there, fans are willing to spend money, and the NCAA is making plenty of it, mostly because of the labor of elite basketball players.
  Think about it: These players could be earning money for public appearances leading up to March Madness and further promoting the NCAA.
  None of this is currently allowed.
  Current NCAA rules state that scholarship athletes cannot take outside payment.
  The prospect of NCAA athletes earning money is one with bipartisan support.
  Perhaps a time will come where both sides will come together to help these athletes make a living.
  It’s not like anyone is trying to take away NCAA President Mark Emmert’s $2.4 million annual salary.

<p>It brings in more than $900 million annually, as <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/march-madness-follow-the-money/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1554572275319000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF5Az1xmHXQwBB9gDp1_gEwJLJM6g" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/march-madness-follow-the-money/">CBS</a> reported in 2015, with about $770 million of it coming from the 14-year $10.8 billion deal the organization signed with CBS for the tournament’s broadcasting rights back in 2006. Although it brings in this massive revenue for the NCAA, players are not only unable to earn a lucrative salary — although scholarships can also cover food and housing with small stipends — or any revenue sharing from their success, but they are unable to profit from their likeness.</p>
<p>There is an interesting case to be made for paying elite NCAA athletes, but here is what is even more clear: They should at least be able to profit from their likeness. Restrictions the NCAA has put on that are completely absurd.</p>
<p>For many of the athletes competing in the Final Four this weekend, this will be the peak of their athletic careers. Most of them will not make it to the NBA. But they will be playing in what will be the biggest sporting event in the country this weekend. It’s one where fans are oftentimes spending north of $1,000 for tickets, according to <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.ticketiq.com/blog/final-four-tickets-prices-trends&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1554572275319000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG4rGm-K13OnvIt1afp-g8oL0Lvzw" href="https://blog.ticketiq.com/blog/final-four-tickets-prices-trends">ticketiQ</a>.
