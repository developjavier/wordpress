  Why brain games for dogs?
  Have a go at playing these five brain games for dogs, and your four-legged friend will thank you!
  Use your furry friend’s favorite toy, or a treat, and hide it in one of your hands.
  Treasure Hunt This is one of those brain games for dogs that you can play over as little or as large of an area as you like.
  To increase the challenge, hide treats all around the house in separate rooms, once you’ve hidden the treats, ask your dog to hunt.
  To be able to play this game, your dog must know the name of her favorite toys and the “fetch” command.
  Underneath your hands, place a basket, as your dog fetches each item let it pass by your hands into a basket.
  Hot or Cold Hide a treat, or a ball, somewhere around the room.
  The Shell Game (or the Cup Game) This is one of the brain games for dogs that we’ve all heard of.
  Let your dog watch you put the treat underneath a cup so she can see there will be a reward to guessing correctly.
