post_title: 4 Best Homemade Dog Ice Cream Recipes

  Keeping your dog cool on the hot days is not only about comfort but also about your dog's health.
  Keep in mind that the measurements for these recipes are usually designed for organic fruits and veggies.
  For example, if your using a banana made with GMO, it's going to be larger.
  You will need: 2 organic bananas 1 teaspoon flaxseed 5 tablespoons crunchy peanut butter 36 ounces probiotic yogurt An ice cube tray Cut bananas in half, and place them in the blender with your flax, peanut butter, and yogurt.
  While your broth is cooling, line your ice cube trays with yummy training treats like Zukes minis in the salmon or chicken flavor.
  Once the broth has cooled, strain into a bowl and make sure that none end up in the ice cube tray you’ll be using in a moment.
  No matter who happens to be eating it, this yummy melon is great way to stay hydrated since it's made up of 92% water!
  You will need: Half a watermelon 3 tablespoons honey ½ to ¾ cup of coconut water Slice up your watermelon to the appropriate size, then remove the skin and pluck out the seeds.
  Once they’re completely frozen, you’ll have a tasty watermelon ice cream treat for your pup, and something to add a little extra pop to your lemonade.
  Give these pumpkin balls to your dog every other day as a special treat, feeding it to them all the time might upset their stomach because of the cinnamon.

<p><strong>Now that the cold days are coming to a close</strong>, you can expect things to start heating up as we're going through spring and into the hot days of summer. You’ll probably be spending a lot of time with your dog at the beach, the lake, and anywhere else that helps you stay cool while you’re under the sun.</p>
<p>Keeping your dog cool on the hot days is not only about comfort but also about your dog's health. Anything you can do to cool off your pooch will be greatly appreciated by him, and what better way to do it than with some treats? Try some of these frozen dog ice cream recipes and pack them in the cooler when you head out on the road to enjoy your summer vacation.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the measurements for these recipes are usually designed for organic fruits and veggies. It's fine to use non-organic items in your recipe, just remember that the organic variety is usually smaller. For example, if your using a banana made with GMO, it's going to be larger. So you should only use one unless you want a larger portion.</p>

<h2><strong>Peanut Butter Banana Frozen Chews</strong></h2>
<p>Every canine loves peanut butter, but when you add bananas, flaxseed, and yogurt to the mix it becomes a potassium rich, chewy treat!</p>
<h4><strong>You will need:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>2 organic bananas</li>
<li>1 teaspoon flaxseed</li>
<li>5 tablespoons crunchy peanut butter</li>
<li>36 ounces probiotic yogurt</li>
<li>An ice cube tray</li>
</ul>
<p>Cut bananas in half, and place them in the blender with your flax, peanut butter, and yogurt. Briefly pulse the mixture until it has somewhat of a smoothie texture with chunkier parts in it. Pour the contents of your blender into the ice cube tray evenly, if you want to be creative with the shapes you can also purchase trays that are designed with cute shapes.</p>
<p>Cover the tray with cling wrap and leave it in your freezer for 12 to 24 hours. Thaw them for about 15 to 20 minutes before serving them up, this way they’ll be easy to chew and your pup won’t hurt their teeth!</p>
<p><em>Tip: Just to be clear, you can forego the yogurt if your dog is lactose intolerant! If you do, cut down to half a teaspoon of flaxseed. The purpose of flax is to introduce more Omega fatty acids to their diet, and to help the cubes keep somewhat of a solid hold. They won’t melt...</em></p> <p class="article-info-more"> <a href="https://topdogtips.com/best-homemade-dog-ice-cream-recipes/" target="_blank">Click here to read more</a> </p>
