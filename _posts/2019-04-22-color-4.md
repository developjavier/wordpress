post_excerpt: |
  I am stunned by, and everlastingly grateful for, the response to Willie’s death.
  Someday, just not yet today.
  Today this is what I can do: Post photos of colorful things.
  My brain is working on another blog, about us and dogs and grief and love.
  Here is Bloodroot, which is spreading all over the hill behind our house, thanks to ants, who eat an organ called an elaisome on the seeds, and then toss the seeds in the ant trash heap.
  It’s white flowers lighten up an otherwise drab hillside, and it’s spreading like crazy.
  Scilla siberica also immigrates itself all over our gardens.
  But it’s impossible to have too much, so I keep transplanting the little bulbs to new places.
  I adore it almost as much as does a species of a small, native bee.
  We colored some eggs with our dear friends D & J. It’s an Easter ritual for us–good to keep those traditions going.
