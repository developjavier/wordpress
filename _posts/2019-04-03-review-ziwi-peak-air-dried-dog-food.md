  The current boom in the pet food industry is all about healthy, safe ingredients.
  Now, we're beginning to see more products like Ziwi Peak Air Dried Dog Food that are focussed on providing quality nutrition with wholesome ingredients.
  Ziwi Peak Air Dried Dog Food Review As you can see from the photo above, this dog food looks like small pieces of beef jerky.
  The protein source is the first ingredient in every recipe, and you can smell it as soon as you open the package.
  100% of the meat and seafood in Ziwi Peak recipes are sourced from New Zealand.
  If this diet is a good choice for your Fido, you can feed smaller portions than with most other commercial dog food products due to the high nutritional density.
  Ziwi Peak Air Dried Dog Food includes 96% meat and/or organ meat and 3% green-lipped mussels.
  As an example, the ingredient list for the Lamb recipe is lamb meat, liver, lung, tripe, heart and kidney, New Zealand Green Mussel, lecithin, chicory inulin, dried kelp, parsley, naturally preserved with mixed tocopherols, vitamins and minerals.
  Ziwi says it costs about $3.27 per day to feed a 20-pound with their Peak Air Dried Dog Food.
  While it's more expensive than lower quality food products, I think this option is a good value for the money if you're looking to feed a top-quality dog food or want a nutritious topper for your pet's meals.

<p>The current boom in the pet food industry is all about healthy, safe ingredients. Pet owners have begun to realize the dangers of overly processed food, and veterinarians are urging people to feed their pets a better quality diet â€“ cutting out fillers and artificial ingredients. Now, we're beginning to see more products like <strong>Ziwi Peak Air Dried Dog Food</strong> that are focussed on providing quality nutrition with wholesome ingredients.</p>
<p>There are many commercial dog foods that <a href="https://topdogtips.com/dangerous-dog-food-ingredients/">are not healthy</a> for your pet to eat. Sadly, due to the lack of government rules and regulations in the industry these pet foods can be found on store shelves right now. It's extremely important to do some research and pay attention to the ingredients in your dog's food.</p>
<p>Ziwi has taken a different approach to creating their line of pet food and treats. They use an air drying technique to naturally preserve the ingredients, while eliminating pathogens and protecting the nutrients.</p>
