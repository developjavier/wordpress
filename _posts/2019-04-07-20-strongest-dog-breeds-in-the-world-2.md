<p><strong>If you are like me, you love big, strong dogs.</strong> There is something about having a pack of muscles to snuggle up to at night. I never feel safer than I do when I know I'm being protected from any would-be intruders by one of the <strong>strongest dog breeds</strong> in the world.</p>
<p>There are definite benefits to adopting a strong dog, but they have their drawbacks too. Typically, strong dogs aren't the best option for homes with children. These dogs can overpower large adults, so a child would certainly never be able to control one of these pooches. If you want your <a href="https://topdogtips.com/should-children-help-train-the-family-dog/">kids to be involved</a> in the care of your pet, one of these breeds may not be the best option.</p>
<p>If you're looking for a sporting dog or working breed to help around your homestead, these strong canines may be just what you need. Every breed has their pros and cons, and I've listed them all out here.</p>
<p>Be sure to do extensive research before adopting one of the strongest dog breeds that you're not familiar with. The only way to ensure that your home is going to be a good fit for your new pet is to know what you're getting into before you bring Fido home.</p>

<h2><strong>20 Strongest Dog Breeds In the World</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>1. Alaskan Malamute</strong></h3>
<p>Taking the top spot on my list is the Alaskan Malamute (pictured above). This breed prefers the colder temperatures. If you like dogs that “talk”, then the Malamute is for you. Just make sure you have a strong, tall enclosure.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong> – Pooches in this breed are strong. They can pull sleds, pack supplies, and cart freight. Alaskan Malamutes love to roam and climb. They are happiest with a busy, outdoors family that will have time to teach and train them to be useful. Friendly and affectionate, these dogs do great with kids.</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong> – This breed usually does not like other animals. Double-coated, these fur-babies do not do well in hot temperatures. Malamutes are reserved with strangers and will need socialization training from a young age to keep from becoming fearful and aggressive. These pups do love to dig, so be prepared!</p>
<h3><strong>2. Bandog</strong></h3>
<p>This is a breed of varied ancestry. They were originally created by breeding “Mastiff” breeds with “Bull Dog” breeds.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong> – This breed is still mainly bred to be guard dogs, and they excel. Brave and strong, these dogs will lay down their life for their charges. These impressive animals have short, easy to care for coats. These pups can be affectionate and loyal with their adult owners, but they are not recommended for kids and other animals</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong> – As primarily guard dogs, these canines can be dangerous. They need intense “pack leader” training. They are wary and distrustful of strangers, so they need intense socialization training from birth. To many, the Bandog is considered a mutt, so you will not be able to receive AKC certification. If that is your dream, it is best to choose another breed.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Bernese Mountain Dog</strong></h3>
<p>This wooly dog needs cool temperatures to be healthy. These pups are also known as the “Berner”.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong> – Affectionate and friendly, the Bernese Mountain Dog may be one of the strongest dog breeds, but they are also great with children and other pets. Originally a working breed, they still love to work and enjoy learning tricks and playing sports. Intelligent and wanting to please, these giants are easy to train. You don’t have to worry about aggression in these fur-babies, they are friendly with everyone they meet.</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong> – While extremely beautiful, their long coats do need brushing and cleaning. They also shed quite a bit. If you don’t like body fluids, this drooling beast is not for you. Playful, large and strong, canines in this breed will <a href="https://topdogtips.com/best-obedience-school-for-dogs/">need obedience training</a> starting from a young age.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Boxer</strong></h3>
<p>This breed has an imposing stature that doesn’t match its personality. They usually won’t hurt a fly, but they may kill furry little animals if they are not trained.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong> – This affectionate dog is very friendly with family, including kids and other dogs. Boxers are intelligent and easy to train. They are average in their desire to bark and roam. This energetic furry family member will adapt to apartment living as long as they get plenty of exercise.</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong> – The may make strangers feel timid with their muscular body, but they don’t really <a href="https://topdogtips.com/best-watch-dogs/">make good watch dogs</a> because of their friendliness. Boxers like mild climates, so care must be taken when going outside in cold or hot weather. They may be one of the strongest dog breeds physically, but these pups really do not do well when left alone for long periods of time.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Bull Dogs (Pitbull, American, English, etc.)</strong></h3>
<p>Bulldogs have a bad reputation right now because of the “Pitbull”. Actually, all Bully breeds can be docile if trained properly.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong> – Intelligent and loyal, these muscular companions are easy to train. With short hair, the Bull Dog doesn’t need a lot of time at the groomers. Known as <a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/1072662/larger-life-lap-dogs">“nanny dogs”,</a> these pups love children. They are playful and protective. Most of the canines in these breeds are calm and quiet.</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong> – Make sure you get your fur-baby from a reputable breeder that doesn’t breed fighting dogs. Like other strong breeds, you will need to start with socialization and “pack leader” training early. Some people will greet you and your pup with fear and maybe anger. Their emotions can affect your dog’s emotions. Prepare your fur-baby properly.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Caucasian Ovcharka</strong></h3>
<p>This Russian dog is a shepherd, and it is tough. It can kill wolves and bears to keep its charges safe, which is one of the main reasons it makes my list of the strongest dog breeds.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong> – This breed was made to survive barren, wet lands and bitter cold; so, it is one tough cookie. Independent and self-assured, these canines usually do well with alone time. Brave and loyal, this breed is a common police, rescue, and working dog in the areas of the old Soviet Union.</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong> – Serious and professional, this is not a great dog if you have kids and other pets. This breed is not suited for warmer climates. If you want to own this pooch as a companion dog, or a guard dog, it will need to undergo serious “pack leader” training and obedience classes. It will be a danger to strangers if not socialized properly.</p>
<h3><strong>7. Doberman Pinscher</strong></h3>
<p>You may not be surprised to see the Doberman Pinscher on this list of the strongest dog breeds. These dogs grow to a large size, but are still incredibly graceful. These trim pooches are actually in the “Mastiff” family.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong> – This brave, loyal dog is very affectionate with his family. He makes a great watch dog. These intelligent, sensitive canines are easy to train. They will need socialization and “pack leader” training, but they will pick it up quickly. If you are looking for a guard dog, Doberman’s make great ones. That is their traditional job.</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong> – Energetic and playful, these dogs need to be exercised regularly to keep from being aggressive or destructive. While this dog is friendly with kids it is...</p> <p class="article-info-more"> <a href="https://topdogtips.com/strongest-dog-breeds/" target="_blank">Click here to read more</a> </p>
