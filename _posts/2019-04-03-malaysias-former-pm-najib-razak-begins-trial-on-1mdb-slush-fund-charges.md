  ET Malaysia's former Prime Minister Najib Razak is on trial in a wide-ranging corruption case, accused of siphoning millions of dollars from a state investment fund called 1MDB.
  Najib's trial began Wednesday, nearly a year after he was voted out of office. "Investigations by other countries allege that hundreds of millions found their way into Najib's accounts over the years."
  While the government's allegations against Najib involve more than $680 million in state funds that wound up in his personal bank accounts, the 1MDB fund accumulated some $6.5 billion — money raised with the help of U.S. bank Goldman Sachs, which also faces charges related to 1MDB.
  Others who have been charged in the scandal include Malaysian financier Jho Low — believed to be the fraud's mastermind — along with two former Goldman Sachs bankers. "Low helped him to funnel money around the world — and $1 billion into Najib's account, that Najib then used to pay off politicians in his home country.
  But unbeknownst to Najib, Jho Low then used billions more to fund a billionaire's lifestyle.
  He partied with Hollywood celebrities, he bought storied U.S. companies like EMI Music Publishing.
  Malaysia is currently led by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the country's previous long-time leader who returned to the post last year, when Najib's political party lost power for the first time in more than 60 years.

<p>Malaysia's former Prime Minister Najib Razak is on trial in a wide-ranging corruption case, accused of siphoning millions of dollars from a state investment fund called 1MDB. Najib's trial began Wednesday, nearly a year after he was voted out of office.</p>
<p>Najib, 65, has insisted he is innocent, saying he didn't improperly enrich himself during the decade in which he jointly served as Malaysia's prime minister and finance minister. But prosecutors say those dual posts gave Najib nearly absolute authority — and that he criminally abused it.</p>
<p>"Today's trial involves the transfer of more than $10 million into Najib's personal account from an account linked to 1MDB," NPR's Michael Sullivan reports from Kuala Lumpur. "Investigations by other countries allege that hundreds of millions found their way into Najib's accounts over the years."</p>
<p>The former prime minister is facing a raft of charges that include criminal breach of trust and money laundering — and Wednesday's trial is the first of many cases brought against him in connection with the broader 1MBD scandal and the alleged misuse of billions of dollars.</p>
<p>While the government's allegations against Najib involve more than $680 million in state funds that wound up in his personal bank accounts, the 1MDB fund accumulated some $6.5 billion — money raised with the help of U.S. bank Goldman Sachs, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/12/17/677360033/goldman-sachs-faces-charges-in-malaysia-over-massive-corruption-scandal">which also faces charges related to 1MDB</a>.</p>
<p>Founded in 2009, the alleged slush-fund snowballed from being a <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/05/18/612233783/malaysian-police-seize-cash-jewels-designer-bags-from-ousted-premiers-residence">tool for exorbitant lifestyles</a> to fueling massive pet projects.</p>
<p>The U.S. Justice Department <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-seeks-recover-approximately-540-million-obtained-corruption-involving-malaysian-sovereign">said in 2017</a> that it believes Malaysian kleptocrats stole at least $4.5 billion from 1MDB accounts, and that some of that money was laundered through shell companies before being used to buy luxury items and make investments in the U.S.</p>
