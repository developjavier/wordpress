post_title: 'DogTime Review: The FurEater Is A Must-Have For Pet Owners In Shedding Season'
author: Jessica Goldberg
post_excerpt: |
  I have two Chihuahua mixes and one large Calico cat all living in the same modest two-bedroom apartment.
  The FurEater is boasted as “the pet hair remover that works!” I’ve tried HEPA vacuums, lint rollers, and allergen wipes to remove stubborn fur from areas like the creases of my recliner and the floor of my car.
  I connected my FurEater extension to my roommate’s wet-dry vacuum and got to work.
  When it comes to upholstery, nothing has been as effective at removing pet hair as the FurEater.
  It’s easy to suck up the fur once the attachment has loosened it up and gathered it in one clump.
  You can use the attachment alone like a lint brush to gather stray hairs or fibers into an easy-to-pull-off clump.
  The attachment’s bristles are designed to loosen up fur intertwined in the fibers of clothing, furniture, and other fabric surfaces.
  The FurEater attachment currently goes for $25.99 on Amazon.
  FurEater not only cut down on this cost, but made cleaning easier, as well.
  FurEater has a handy guide on their website so you don’t get stuck with a piece of cleaning equipment you can only use sans vacuum.

<p>I have two <a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/chihuahua">Chihuahua</a> mixes and one large Calico cat all living in the same modest two-bedroom apartment. Despite vacuuming regularly and giving the animals <a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-health/general/1108-keeping-dogs-groomed-aspca">dry baths</a> and brush sessions, tiny white hairs have made their way into every nook and cranny of my apartment.</p>
<p>For me, finding fur everywhere has become the norm. So when the folks over at <a href="https://www.fureater.com/#fureater"><strong>FurEater</strong></a> offered to send their vacuum attachment, I was more than ready to try it out.</p>
<p>The FurEater is boasted as “the pet hair remover that works!” I’ve tried HEPA vacuums, lint rollers, and allergen wipes to remove stubborn fur from areas like the creases of my recliner and the floor of my car.</p>
<p>While those have all alleviated some of the mess, none have been quite as effective as the FurEater.</p>
<p>Here’s how the FurEater is a game changer when it comes to cleaning up my fur family’s stray hairs.</p>
<h2>How The FurEater Works</h2>

<p>The FurEater comes in several sizes and offers several adapters, and it connects to the hose of your vacuum cleaner. I connected my FurEater extension to my roommate’s wet-dry vacuum and got to work.</p>
<p>When it comes to upholstery, nothing has been as effective at removing pet hair as the FurEater. To use it, I simply turned my vacuum on and applied a medium-amount of pressure as I slowly dragged the it across the surface of my furniture.</p>
<p>The FurEater tends to gather the fur first before sucking it up. As you pull the extension across the surface, the clump of gathered fur will become larger and...</p> <p class="article-info-more"> <a href="https://dogtime.com/product-reviews/76335-dogtime-review-fureater?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=dogtime-review-fureater" target="_blank">Click here to read more</a> </p>
