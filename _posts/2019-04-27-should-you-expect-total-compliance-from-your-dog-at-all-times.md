  Should You Expect Total Compliance from
  Your Dog at All Times?

  In the end, she had decided to leave Ginger’s head area alone.
  Still, she was clearly distraught over the episode.
  Part of the reason the woman was so upset is that she follows the philosophy that if a dog doesn’t allow us to do something, or disobeys a request, that he is being dominant.
  She believes we should be able to do anything we want to our dogs and they should, without question, let us.
  Should another person be able to do anything they like to you, in whatever way that they like, whether it scares the hell out of you or not?
  The man had the dog up on a table and was brandishing a pair of long, pointed scissors with one hand while attempting to hold the dog still by squeezing his other hand around her throat.
  I too was horrified, watching with my hands half covering my eyes, afraid that the poor dog was about to be blinded.
  After a few snips, the man handed the scissors to the owner and then restrained the dog with both hands around the throat as the woman made a half-hearted attempt to trim the bangs.
  But, if your dog becomes frightened or reactive when you do those things, rather than becoming indignant or angry, the kinder and more productive route is to take the time and make the effort to help your dog learn that there’s nothing to be afraid of; in the long run, it will make things easier for both of you.

<p>In a recent conversation with another dog owner, I heard this phrase: “She’s being a little s#*%!” When I asked what the woman meant, she replied that Ginger, her very mini, long-haired mix, wasn’t at all compliant when she tried to groom her around the head area. Ginger, she related with indignity, thrashed and threatened to bite! Although the woman had been a vet tech and certainly knows how to restrain dogs, the task was almost impossible. Then she mentioned the buzzing noise, and I realized she’d been using clipping shears, which make a noise that can be frightening to some dogs. In the end, she had decided to leave Ginger’s head area alone. Still, she was clearly distraught over the episode.</p>

Does this all or nothing philosophy really serve us <em>or</em> our dogs?</p>
<p>Dogs are living beings who have fears, likes, and dislikes, just like we do. Should another person be able to do anything they like to <em>you</em>, in whatever way that they like, whether it scares the hell out of you or not? I’m not suggesting we shouldn’t be able to handle our dogs. Of course we should. I came in from a walk just this morning with two wet, muddy dogs. Had I not...</p> <p class="article-info-more"> <a href="https://wildewmn.wordpress.com/2019/03/28/should-you-have-complete-compliance-from-your-dog/" target="_blank">Click here to read more</a> </p>
