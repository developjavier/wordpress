post_title: 'Coachella: Ariana Grande becomes fourth woman to headline, brings out *NSYNC members and others'
author: Jessica Goldberg
post_excerpt: |
  Ariana Grande closed out Weekend One of Coachella in style, putting together a set that included special guests, stunning visuals, and of course her undeniable voice.
  She kicked off her set with a bang, belting her way through "God Is A Woman," her crisp voice cutting through the night air.
  The much-rumored — and hinted at on social media — reunion of *NSYNC did in fact happen as the famous boy band (minus Justin Timberlake) came out to sing her song "Break Up With Your Girlfriend, I'm Bored."
  In a cute twist, the video screens showed ripples and old numbers as though the audience was watching a VHS tape of the performance.
  The guys thanked the crowd and left.
  While there, they also sang "Bang!
  She held the audience captivated throughout the night whether it was poppy dance hits like "7 Rings" or more emotional songs like "Breathin" which she sang while being circled by about a dozen women playing violins.
  Her second-to-last song was "No Tears Left To Cry" which she actually also sang at Coachella last year when she did a surprise performance with Kygo and sang the then-newly released single.
  Grande ended by listening to the crowd as they shouted "Thank U, Next" in unison as she pretended to be done without playing her signature hit.
