  More than a dozen school districts in Colorado are closed Wednesday after the FBI and local law enforcement warned of an 18-year-old white woman who is "armed and dangerous" in the Denver metropolitan area.
  Sol Pais flew from Miami to Denver on Monday and "immediately" bought a pump action shotgun and ammunition, FBI Denver Special Agent In Charge Dean Phillips told reporters Tuesday evening.
  She was last seen in the foothills of Jefferson County, in the metro Denver area.

  The 20th anniversary of the Columbine shooting is Saturday.
  Jefferson County (JeffCo) Public Schools, of which Columbine is a part, are closed as well.
  Fourteen other school districts in the area are closed as well, according to Colorado Public Radio.
  Pais had not been charged with a crime as of Tuesday evening, Phillips told reporters. "We take these threats seriously," Jefferson County Sheriff Jeff Shrader told reporters.
  Two students at Columbine High School killed 13 people and injured 24 more and then killed themselves on April 20, 1999.
