  What Is Intermittent Fasting?
  Intermittent fasting, or therapeutic fasting as it is sometimes called, is an eating pattern that includes alternating cycles of eating and fasting.
  Intermittent fasting for dogs and time restricted feeding hasn't been researched as well in canines as it has in humans, but there are some studies with animals.
  You can also feed him twice a day, but in the period of 6-8 hours.
  While this is often attributed to the fact that food can often be scarce for predators in nature, this also means that their bodies are naturally equipped to stay healthy during the long periods of fasting.
  Dogs in the wild usually only have one meal per day and sometimes even go for days without food.
  Potential Benefits of Intermittent Fasting for Dogs More studies on mice and rats have shown that intermittent fasting comes with many benefits, like weight loss or even increased life span.
  Tissue Regeneration When your dog is left without food for an extended time, his body will start killing of damaged cells and use them or energy.
  Once you feed your dog again, the stem cells replace the cells his body cannibalized with new, healthy cells.
  Intermittent fasting for dogs comes with many potential benefits, like weight loss, improved immune system and better health in general.

<p><strong>Intermittent fasting has become extremely</strong> popular in the last few years due to tons of scientifically proven benefits for humans, one of which is obviously weight loss. With these positive effects in mind, you may wonder about the effects of intermittent fasting for dogs and whether it is good or bad for them.</p>
<h3><strong>What Is Intermittent Fasting?</strong></h3>
<p>Intermittent fasting, or therapeutic fasting as it is sometimes called, is an eating pattern that includes alternating cycles of eating and fasting. There are a few different methods to intermittent fasting, all based on the amount of time that passes between eating cycles.</p>
<p>The most popular method of intermittent fasting for humans is the one in which you eat 8 hours every day and fast for 16 hours, originally developed by Swedish personal trainer and nutritionist Markin Berkhan of <a href="https://leangains.com/"><em>Leangains</em></a>. This basically means skipping breakfast, eating around noon for the first time and not eating anything after 8 pm.</p>
<p>Intermittent fasting for dogs and time restricted feeding hasn't been researched as well in canines as it has in humans, but there are some studies with animals. For example, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5537224/">one 2017 study</a> shows that it extends lifespan. Veterinarians at Dogs Naturally Magazine has looked into <a href="https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/why-you-should-fast-your-dog/">more clinical research</a> on the benefits of fasting for dogs. Dr Karen Becker of Mercola have also published an extensive piece on <a href="https://healthypets.mercola.com/sites/healthypets/archive/2018/05/27/pets-therapeutic-fasting.aspx">the ways and benefits</a> of therapeutic fasting in dogs.</p>
<p>While there are some potential benefits, there could also be side effects and dangers when this diet is administered improperly. It's crucial to discuss this with your veterinarian or canine nutritionist before you attempt to fast your dog.</p>
<p>Many dog owners already feed their dogs just one meal on a daily basis. If thatâ€™s the way you feed your pup, another option is trying the <strong>4:3 diet instead</strong>, in which you would not feed your pooch for three days a week. If you feed your dog two or three meals a day, try feeding him only once. You can also feed him twice a day, but in the period of 6-8 hours.</p>
<p>Human body, just like the body of dogs and many other animals, uses a few different energy sources. When you fast, your body goes into ketosis, which means that instead of glucose, your body uses fat as an energy source. When the fat breaks down during ketosis, one of the components released are ketones, which are used for fuel. This leads to weight loss and other positive effects.</p>
<h3><strong>Is Intermittent Fasting Good for Dogs?</strong></h3>
<p>Wild dogs fast as a way of life, just like wolves, the closest living relatives of dogs. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16772460">A study on of wolves</a> in Yellowstone National...</p> <p class="article-info-more"> <a href="https://topdogtips.com/intermittent-fasting-for-dogs/" target="_blank">Click here to read more</a> </p>
