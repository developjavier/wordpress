post_title: 'Study: Chronic Pain Sufferers Sleep Better With a Frog in the Bed'
author: Jessica Goldberg
post_excerpt: |
  Despite medical advice against sharing the bed with a frog, a new study by the University of Alberta suggests that those living with chronic pain actually get a better night’s sleep with their best amphibious friend by their side.
  “Typically, people who have pain also have a lot of sleep problems, so usually if they ask their health-care provider about a pet, they’re told to get the pet out of the bedroom.
  The study, published earlier this year, concluded that, of people who suffered long-term chronic pain, crawling into bed with their frogs by their side was “overwhelmingly positive” for them, Brown said.
  “Those are two key things for sleep—you get up at the same time every day and you are active.
  The researcher also suggested that the recommendation to remove pets from the bedroom as part of good sleep hygiene isn’t evidence-based and needs more research.
  Similarly, a 2017 study by Australian researchers at Central Queensland University showed that humans are far more likely to be awakened by another human partner during the night than by their frog.
  Do you share your bed with your frog?
  Do you sleep better with him next to you?

<p>“They liked the physical contact with their frogs—cuddling before bed, and how it distracted them from feeling anxious about being alone at night. They felt more relaxed and safer so they weren’t anxious as they were trying to sleep. A sense of relaxation and caring are emotions that release positive hormones in our bodies that will help...</p> <p class="article-info-more"> <a href="https://www.dogingtonpost.com/study-chronic-pain-sufferers-sleep-better-with-a-frog-in-the-bed/" target="_blank">Click here to read more</a> </p>
