  These collars are best for dogs that have been trained to walk properly on a leash without pulling.
  Risks associated with traditional collars: Studies have shown that dogs that tend to pull on a leash attached to a traditional collar can suffer serious tracheal damage as a result.
  Training Collars: Training collars are designed to assist pet parents in controlling a dog that either isn’t trained or is in the process of being trained to walk nicely on a leash or for dogs that tend to back-out of traditional collars.
  Although they tighten with pulling, they’re designed in such a way that, when properly fitted, cannot choke or strangle the dog, but simply keep the collar from slipping off.
  Choke/slip collar.
  Prong/pinch collar.
  Benefits of training collars: Martingale collars are a suitable solution for owners of breeds that can’t wear traditional collars due to the shape and size of their head and neck.
  Harnesses: There are two basic types of harnesses, standard harness and no-pull harnesses.
  No-pull harnesses typically clip on the dog’s chest so that if they pull on the leash, they are pulled toward the side instead of effectively pulling in the direction they want to go.
  Which type of collar, halter, or harness do you use for your dog?

How could you possibly choose? Not every collar will be appropriate for every dog and no single option is the best when it comes to choosing your dog’s collar or harness.</p>

<p>In choosing what type of collar or harness to use, you’ll need to consider both your own lifestyle and that of your dog. Are you and your dog very active? Does she like to play in the mud or water often? Do you spend a lot of time outdoors in the early morning or evening when visibility is reduced?</p>
<p>You’ll also need to consider your dog’s physical characteristics and behaviors. Is he a breed with a wide neck or narrow head? Is your dog well trained or does he begin to pull as soon as a leash is clipped on?</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll cover the wide variety of collars, halters, and harnesses available and how to choose the one that will work best for YOUR unique dog.</p>
<p><strong>Traditional Collars:</strong></p>
<p>Traditional collars are the most common and the most popular. They’re available in a wide variety of fabrics, typically nylon, leather, cotton, or rubber. Also known as flat collars, they simply fit around your dog’s neck by either a buckle or clip and are adjustable to a range of sizes to accommodate a growing dog.</p>
<p>When choosing a traditional collar, think of your dog’s lifestyle and choose accordingly. If your dog is outside or is walked during early morning or at night when visibility is reduced, look for a reflective collar. If he tends to play dirty, look for a waterproof or rubber collar that won’t get funky and moldy after a few trips to the lake. These collars are best for dogs that have been trained to walk properly on a leash without pulling.</p>
<p>You’ll also want to consider the ratings and reviews from other dog moms and dads who’ve put the collar to the test.

<p><strong>Benefits of traditional collars:</strong> Because traditional collars come in such a huge variety of colors, patterns, and fabrics, and they’re typically quite affordable, many pet parents choose several and change them to suit their mood or the season. Another great aspect of traditional collars is their ability to be customized! Dress up any collar with flowers or bow ties that clip on, fun novelty dog tags, or bandanas that slip over the collar and are more easily held in place.</p>
<p><strong>Risks associated with traditional collars:</strong> Studies have shown that dogs that tend to pull on a leash attached to a traditional collar can suffer serious tracheal damage as a result. If your dog is an avid leash puller, consider using a harness during walks. Additionally, traditional collars can pose a choking or strangulation hazard if a dog is left unattended while wearing one. Because collars traditionally carry important identification, consider using a break-away collar while your dog is unattended and make sure he’s microchipped.</p>
<p><strong>Training Collars:</strong></p>
<p>Training collars are designed to assist pet parents in controlling a dog that either isn’t trained or is in the process of being trained to walk nicely on a leash or for dogs that tend to back-out of traditional collars.</p>
<p><strong>Some examples of training collars are:</strong></p>
