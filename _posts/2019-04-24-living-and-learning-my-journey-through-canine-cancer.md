  He inspired me to make my first feature documentary, Black Beauty Breed, a film that profiled the Rottweiler.
  During that time, I learned that Rottweilers and other large breeds were prone to Osteosarcoma which is a type of bone cancer.
  Samson was 9 years old and the bone cancer tumor was advanced enough to spread through his body even after amputation.
  Make your dogs life as comfortable as possible and give them lots of love and cuddles during the last few days or months of their lives.
  I know it is hard to get several opinions in a race to save a dog’s life, but I really wish I would have talked to other veterinary oncologists before I moved forward with the amputation.
  I probably could have caught the tumor earlier had I done this regularly with Samson.
  After many days filled with grief and sorrow following Samson’s passing, I decided to make a documentary about the experience in an effort to help others make more informed decisions than the ones I made.
  I know how important dogs are to the people who have them.
  She fell in love with the breed after rescuing a Rottweiler in 2007 and created the film to give the Rottweiler a fair and more balanced portrayal in the media.
  During the filming of Black Beauty Breed, Ruiz learned that the Rottweiler and other large breed dogs are prone to bone cancer and was deeply affected when her own dog was diagnosed with osteosarcoma.

<p>It was love at first sight when I met the Rottweiler that I would ultimately adopt. He was 9 months old and 90 lbs! He was surrendered by a family who could no longer keep him and I volunteered to pick him up and drive him to the Rottweiler Rescue of Los Angeles. During the two-hour drive back to Los Angeles I looked in the rearview mirror and saw the most beautiful face staring back at me with great sadness in his eyes. At that moment, I made the decision to rescue him myself. His name was Samson.</p>

<p>My husband and I welcomed Samson into our home with open arms. In many ways he was our first baby before we had children of our own. Smart and hilarious, he constantly entertained us with his goofy antics. I am smiling as I write this thinking of those times. We grew to love him and the Rottweiler breed in general. He inspired me to make my first feature documentary, <a href="https://blackbeautybreedstore.com/">Black Beauty Breed</a>, a film that profiled the Rottweiler.</p>
<p>During that time, I learned that Rottweilers and other large breeds were prone to Osteosarcoma which is a type of bone cancer. It affects one in every eight Rottweilers. Sadly, my Samson became one of the statistics. He was 9 years old when he was diagnosed. We were devastated by the news. Like many people, we scrambled to try and save his life. I just didn’t know much about Osteosarcoma and I wish I had made more informed decisions. A well known veterinarian suggested amputation of his left leg because the tumor was quite pronounced and was affecting his cortical bone. We were told that the amputation could stop the cancer from spreading to other parts of his body. We decided to move forward with the amputation. The surgery was performed by a veterinary orthopedic surgeon. Samson’s recovery seemed to be going great for the first month post surgery. However, we soon learned that the cancer had in fact spread to another part of his body. Our hearts were shattered. We knew it was time to say goodbye. It was one of the saddest moments of our lives. Truthfully, we never got over it.</p>
<p>Looking back on the experience, we learned quite a bit and I’d like...</p> <p class="article-info-more"> <a href="https://www.dogingtonpost.com/living-and-learning-my-journey-through-canine-cancer/" target="_blank">Click here to read more</a> </p>
