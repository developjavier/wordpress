  Soft Brexit, second referendum among the
  options up for vote in Parliament

post_excerpt: |
  On Monday, Parliament will again try to seize the steering wheel from Prime Minister Theresa May, as the House of Commons stages votes on four proposals on how to exit the European Union.
  The two proposals would see Britain remain in closely tied to European trade rules and tariff regimes.
  The other would likely keep Britain from setting off to strike its own independent trade deals.
  All this comes amid growing signs that the British prime minister has lost control of Brexit, her party and her cabinet.
  May’s latest threat: If her Conservative members don’t rally round her deal, she will call for a general election.
  May could by replaced as leader of the government by her own party without the need for a general election.
  On Monday, Parliament was scheduled to first discuss the more than 6 million citizens who signed an online petition to cancel Brexit, making it the most popular petition ever hosted on Parliament’s website.
  Some Conservatives remain deeply opposed to these options, in part because they see it as “Brexit in name only,” crossing all their red lines — preventing Britain from striking new trade deals with countries like the United States and China while keeping the borders wide-open to European migrants.
  Ken Clarke, a veteran Conservative lawmaker who proposed the customs union motion, told the BBC that the option would indeed limit Britain in its ability to agree tariff concessions to non-member E.U.
  He added some Brexiteers espousing the benefits of Global Britain striking new trade deals with countries like America are “getting carried away.” The idea that “Donald Trump is going to suddenly open up his market to us with joy because he’s so pleased we’ve damaged the European Union.

<p>April 1 at 1:11 PM</p>
<p>LONDON — After voting “no” so many times, the British Parliament may be ready to vote “aye” on something.</p>
<p>On Monday, Parliament will again try to seize the steering wheel from Prime Minister Theresa May, as the House of Commons stages votes on four proposals on how to exit the European Union.</p>
<p>Among the top options are two that would call for much softer Brexit than May has envisioned.</p>
<p>The two proposals would see Britain remain in closely tied to European trade rules and tariff regimes. One option would essentially mean that Britain would surrender its ability to control European immigration. The other would likely keep Britain from setting off to strike its own independent trade deals.</p>
<p>Trade experts, describing the two options, say they could deliver a kind of “ultra-soft” Brexit, that sees Britain “take back a bit of control.”</p>
<p>Another popular option may push the government to stage a second referendum to take the questions of how or whether to leave back to the people.</p>
<p>And the fourth essentially seeks to cancel Brexit.</p>
<p>These will be non-binding “indicative votes,” expressing the will of Parliament. An earlier round of votes <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/brexit-votes/2019/03/27/d044bb28-4fcc-11e9-bdb7-44f948cc0605_story.html?utm_term=.e21134913e04">failed to produce a majority</a> for any of eight proposals last week. But a big shift by the Labour Party and other political maneuvering may change the math on Monday evening.</p>
<p>All this comes amid growing signs that the British prime minister has lost control of Brexit, her party and her cabinet.</p>
<p>The Conservative Party is open revolt. Over the weekend, a bloc of 170 Conservative members, including 10 cabinet ministers, wrote to May demanding that Britain leave the E.U. “with or without a deal,” according to the Sunday Times of London.</p>
<p>Her cabinet, meanwhile, is now staffed by coup plotters and direct competitors. Hardline Brexiteers and those ministers pushing for a softer Brexter are both threatening to resign if they don’t get their way.</p>
<p>The government secretaries have become so unruly that May’s own chief whip, Julian Smith, in a rare <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47768884">on-the-record interview</a> with the BBC, described them as the “worst example of ill-discipline in cabinet in British political history.”</p>
<p>Smith’s bold statement of unprecedented bad behavior was remarkable not only for what he said — but who said it.</p>
<p>Chief whips are supposed to be like Victorian children in the extreme, never seen nor heard. They are virtually invisible to the world outside the Palace of Westminster, and their one and only job is to enforce party discipline; in other words, to “whip” their members — via text and WhatsApp group — to vote one way or another.</p>
<p>In his remarks, Smith also said that after the results of the 2017 general election,...</p> <p class="article-info-more"> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/brexit-latest-news/2019/04/01/a609fccc-5258-11e9-bdb7-44f948cc0605_story.html?noredirect=on" target="_blank">Click here to read more</a> </p>
