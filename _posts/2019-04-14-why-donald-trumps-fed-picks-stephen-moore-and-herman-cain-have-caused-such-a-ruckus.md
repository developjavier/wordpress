post_title: 'Why Donald Trump&#8217;s Fed picks Stephen Moore and Herman Cain have caused such a ruckus'
author: Jessica Goldberg
post_excerpt: |
  Trump’s plans to nominate the two political allies followed his repeated criticism of the Fed for raising interest rates last year and his reported musings about whether he could fire Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.
  It’s an independent agency that has a long tradition of remaining insulated from politics so it can do what’s best for the economy.
  The Fed lowers interest rates to stimulate a sluggish economy and raises rates to head off excessive inflation.
  Yet both recently supported Trump’s calls to cut rates, or at least not raise them, despite a much-improved economy and moderately higher inflation.
  But prior to the Clinton years, "presidents regularly talked about Fed policy,” says Nomura economist Lewis Alexander, a former Fed official.
  He served as a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City from 1992 to 1996 in the roles of deputy chairman and then chairman of the board but Duy doesn’t believe that qualifies him to serve on the Fed's board.
  The three current board members Trump has appointed all have deep credentials and experience in economics, including high-level positions in the Treasury Department or banking.
  Trump himself elevated Powell -- a former Treasury official, lawyer and investment banker -- from Fed board member to chairman but has since soured on him because of the rate hikes.
  Duy says Trump was frustrated by the Fed’s four rate hikes last year and so “now picks people he thinks will be more pliable.” Michael Bardo, director of the Center for Monetary and Financial History at Rutgers University, says Trump is worried a recession in 2019 or 2020 could doom his reelection chances and wants to appoint Fed officials who will push growth-enhancing policies.
  “Nixon was really paranoid about a recession.” Could Moore and Cain steer Fed policy in the direction Trump wishes if confirmed by the Senate?

<p>President Donald Trump’s selections for the Federal Reserve board, conservative pundit Stephen Moore and former pizza chain executive Herman Cain, have created a media firestorm. Cain, a Republican who ran for president in 2012, may be set to withdraw from consideration in the face of opposition from Senate Republicans, according to an <a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/herman-cain-expected-withdraw-fed-reserve-board-governors/story?id=62346264">ABC News report Friday</a>, though Moore was still in the running.</p>
<p>Trump’s plans to nominate the two political allies followed his repeated criticism of the Fed for raising interest rates last year and his reported musings about whether he could fire Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.</p>
<p>USA Today reporters Paul Davidson Michael Collins break down why the potential nominations of Moore and Cain have caused such an uproar.</p>
<p><strong>Trump has made many unorthodox picks for Cabinet and other posts. Why have these two generated such controversy?</strong></p>
<p>Simply put, the Fed is a different species than, say, the Department of Education or Environmental Protection Agency. It’s an independent agency that has a long tradition of remaining insulated from politics so it can do what’s best for the economy. The Fed lowers interest rates to stimulate a sluggish economy and raises rates to head off excessive inflation. A hike in rates makes mortgages and other loans more expensive for consumers and businesses, crimping economic growth. But the goal is to prevent runaway inflation down the road that could plunge the economy into recession.</p>
<p>“It may have to make unpopular choices, such as raising interest rates,” says Tim Duy, economics professor at the University of Oregon and author of the FedWatch blog.</p>
<p>And that “may not be in the best interest of the political party” in power, says Peter Conti-Brown, a professor of legal studies and business ethics at the Wharton School in Philadelphia and author of "The Power and Independence of the Federal Reserve."</p>

<p><strong>Why are critics of Moore and Cain saying they are ill-suited for nonpartisan roles?</strong></p>
<p>Both Moore and Cain opposed the Fed’s easy-money, low-rate policies under President Barack Obama even though most economists said such an approach was necessary to pull the nation out of the worst downturn since the Great Depression. Yet both recently supported Trump’s calls to cut rates, or at least not raise them, despite a much-improved economy and moderately higher inflation.</p>
<p>“Their goal is to take the anti-Democrat position in all states of the economy,” Duy says.</p>
<p>Conti-Brown was especially troubled that Cain suggested during his 2012 presidential bid that strong job growth numbers that year were cooked by the Labor Department to help Obama’s reelection chances.</p>
<p>“He has been willing to traffic in conspiracy theories,” Conti-Brown says, adding that casting doubt on the integrity of the government’s economic data is a...</p> <p class="article-info-more"> <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/04/14/herman-cain-stephen-moore-fed-picks-trump-raising-uproar/3447761002/" target="_blank">Click here to read more</a> </p>
