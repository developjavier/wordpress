  JERUSALEM, Israel - Israelis will be glued to their screens Thursday night to watch the Beresheet spacecraft land on the moon.
  If successful, Israel will become the fourth nation after the United States, Russia, and China to touch the moon.
  Israel's Beresheet spacecraft, which was developed by a team of scientists from SpaceIL and Israel Space Industries, is currently orbiting the moon.
  The spacecraft catapulted from the earth about seven weeks ago and is expected to land on the moon approximately 10:25 p.m. (3:25 p.m.
  On Wednesday, the SpaceIL and IAI team successfully completed the last maneuver before landing.
  Once Beresheet lands, its mission will last two to three days.
  It will carry a time capsule containing a database of hundreds of files.
  The capsule will be left on the moon's surface after Israel completes its mission there. "We want the Israeli kids and the Israeli youth to, we want to encourage them to learn STEM subjects - science, technology, engineering and informatics - and we hope that they will have this mission we will create the effect and encourage them," said SpaceIL CEO Dr. Ido Antebi.
  But if everything goes to plan, the State of Israel – our young and small country – will be the fourth country in history to land a spacecraft on the moon."

<p>On Wednesday, the SpaceIL and IAI team successfully completed the last maneuver before landing.</p>
<p>The maneuver lowered the spacecraft’s altitude in preparation for its landing. Beresheet is in elliptical orbit with its perilune (the closest point to the moon) only 15-17 km from the moon's surface.</p>
<p>Beresheet will continue to orbit the moon in elliptical orbit every two hours until it lands.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Israeli scientists spent all night Wednesday working on their last calculations before the big event. NASA is also participating in the mission...</p> <p class="article-info-more"> <a href="https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/2019/april/israel-hours-away-from-historic-moon-landing-heres-where-you-can-watch-it-too" target="_blank">Click here to read more</a> </p>
