  Orthodox Jewish schools in New York have been ordered to ban unvaccinated students, as measles cases in the city continue to climb “at an alarming rate” within the Orthodox community, health officials said.
  In a similar directive late last year, the department ordered yeshivas and child-care centers in the Orthodox Jewish community in the area to keep unvaccinated students out of school during the measles outbreak.
  They have been spreading dangerous misinformation based on fake science,” Health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot, a pediatrician, said in the statement.
  We’ve seen a large increase in the number of people vaccinated in these neighborhoods, but as Passover approaches, we need to do all we can to ensure more people get the vaccine.” [CDC finds 78 new measles cases as outbreak sprints toward record and experts blame anti-vaxxers] The Health Department said 285 measles cases have been recorded in Brooklyn and Queens over the past six months, most of them in the Orthodox Jewish communities, where there has been reluctance to vaccinate children.
  “Since then, there have been additional people from Brooklyn and Queens who were unvaccinated and acquired measles while in Israel,” according to the Health Department.
  U.S. health officials said this week that the number of measles cases across the country has climbed to 465 — the highest number in the past five years.
  The number of people sickened by the highly contagious, occasionally deadly disease climbed by 78 during the first week of April, as four more states reported their first cases of 2019.
  That year, the disease was reported at a rate of 1.83 cases per day.
  Before the introduction of the measles vaccine in 1963, most children contracted the illness — an estimated 3 million to 4 million patients were infected each year in the country, according to CDC data.
  In 2000 — almost four decades after parents began vaccinating their children — measles was declared eliminated in the United States.
