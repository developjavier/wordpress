  I wanted to try it out and see for myself if it helped my anxious pup.
  Do keep THC away from your pup, including both recreation and medicinal marijuana products that you may use.
  When George gets anxious, it stresses me out and makes me so sad.
  Walk… Bump… Walk… Bump… I gave him one Canna-Pet CBD oil capsule every morning and evening for two weeks straight just to see if it made a difference.
  When he gets groomed, he goes with Sara, and they are together most of the time, but he’s just getting grumpy and anxious in his old age.
  It didn’t seem to make a difference when he went to the groomers, but I think that has to do more with him never being crate trained.
  I would definitely recommend and use this product again.
  If that is the case with your pooch, you can give them the liquid form or a biscuit form.
  Before you purchase CBD products to help your dog, you may be wondering if your pooch has anxiety.
  Have you tried CBD products for your pup?

<p>There’s been a lot of buzz lately swirling around about CBD oil and how it can cure countless ailments in humans–and even in dogs. It helps many with depression, seizures, and Parkinson’s Disease. People use it to fight cancer, and it eases pain symptoms. The list goes on and on.</p>
<p>CBD is also supposed to help with anxiety. I wanted to try it out and see for myself if it helped my anxious pup.</p>
<p><strong>For anyone who is still confused on the matter, CBD will not make your dog high. THC is different story entirely. Do keep THC away from your pup, including both recreation and medicinal marijuana products that you may use.</strong></p>
<p>CBD has all the medicinal properties of the marijuana plant without the high, so it’s safe for dogs.</p>
<p>I was happy to get a chance to try out <a href="https://canna-pet.com/">Canna-Pet</a>‘s CBD products for dogs with my pooch, George. Here’s how it went.</p>
<h2>CBD For Blind, Anxious George</h2>

<p>I have two dogs in my home–one is a 15-year-old Shih Tzu pup, George, who started losing his eye sight about four years ago. Along with his fading vision, he’s had increased anxiety.</p>
<p>When George gets anxious, it stresses me out and makes me so sad. He paces erratically through the house and bumps into walls. <em>Walk… Bump… Walk… Bump…</em></p>
<p>I gave him one Canna-Pet CBD oil capsule every morning and evening for two weeks straight just to see if it made a difference.</p>
<p>Two Week Trial</p>
<p>At the end of two weeks I realized that George did not do any of his anxious pacing at all during that time.</p>
<p>No bumping into walls. No howling for no reason.</p>
<p>I would say that I definitely noticed a positive difference.</p>
<p>Grooming</p>
<p>George had a grooming appointment during the time I was giving him the CBD capsules. The groomer said that George really loathes being in a kennel without his sibling dog, Sara, and did vocalize his displeasure.</p>
<p>Having a second dog has been the best way to manage Georgie’s stress. When he gets groomed, he goes with Sara, and they are together most of the time, but he’s just getting grumpy and anxious in his old age.</p>
<p>The CBD didn’t stop George’s...</p> <p class="article-info-more"> <a href="https://dogtime.com/product-reviews/76361-dogtime-review-canna-pet-cbd?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=dogtime-review-canna-pet-cbd" target="_blank">Click here to read more</a> </p>
