  Trump backs off threat to close southern
  border immediately, says he’ll give
  Mexico ‘one-year warning’ on drugs,
  migrants

post_excerpt: |
  President Trump on Thursday backed down from his threat to close the southern border immediately, telling reporters at the White House that he is giving Mexico a “one-year warning” before taking action.
  Trump had said he would close the border, or at least large sections of it, this week if Mexico does not halt illegal immigration into the United States.
  But in Thursday’s exchange with reporters, Trump shifted gears, saying that if Mexico does not make progress on stemming the flow of drugs and migrants into the United States within the next year, he will impose tariffs on cars and close the border.
  “We’re going to give them a one-year warning, and if the drugs don’t stop or largely stop, we’re going to put tariffs on Mexico and products, particularly cars.
  The apparent turnaround comes amid mounting warnings from advisers and business leaders that closing the 2,000-mile border with Mexico, the United States’s third-largest trading partner, could be economically devastating to both countries.
  Trump is scheduled to visit the U.S.-Mexico border on Friday.
  “But also, he wants to show a lot of people firsthand exactly what is taking place at the border.” Democrats are continuing to explore ways to undo Trump’s border emergency declaration, which he intends to use to shift tens of billions of dollars from other congressionally funded projects to build his border wall.
  The Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group, a panel consisting of the top House leaders, voted in a private meeting earlier Thursday to authorize litigation opposing Trump’s moves.
  Democrats and some Republicans argue that he is unconstitutionally circumventing Congress’s power to direct federal appropriations.
  — was 3-2 along party lines, according to Hoyer.
