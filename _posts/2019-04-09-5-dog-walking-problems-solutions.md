  Going “crazy” when you bring out the leash Your dog has paired the fun of a walk with the leash, and some dogs go “crazy” and jump all over their owners or twirl around so quickly it’s hard to even attach the leash.
  Don’t begin a walk in that frenzied state, as your dog is already worked up.
  Then do the same reinforcement as you attach and re-attach the leash several times a day but without heading out for a walk.
  The idea is to reframe what the leash means to the dog, and now you want it to mean either “Sit” or “Show me calm behavior.” When your dog gives you a calm behavior, then you can attach the leash and start the walk.
  Repeat inside your home and then move to your back or front yard (or balcony or hallway in an apartment).
  That can be put on cue as well, such as “Sniff!” or “Smell time!” Other clients start off with a long smelling spree and then tell the dog that’s enough and that sniff time is over.
  A reactive dog sees another dog in the distance, and that sight — the other dog — brings the dog at the end of my leash some terrific meat or cheese tidbit.
  In other words, I want to pair yummy treats with the first sighting of a trigger.
  The second I see his ears turning toward me after I call his name, I say “Yes!” and toss another treat over his body.
  With some time training at home, you and your dog really can learn to walk nicely together and both enjoy your daily walk.

<p>Walking with your dog is supposed to be relaxing and fun for you both, but so often it is a struggle and anything but fun for either of you. Here are some of the top five problems and solutions dog parents often encounter on their walks. But you can take back the walk and make it worthwhile and enjoyable for both you and your dog.</p>
<h3>1. Going “crazy” when you bring out the leash</h3>

<p>Your dog has paired the fun of a walk with the leash, and some dogs go “crazy” and jump all over their owners or twirl around so quickly it’s hard to even attach the leash. Don’t begin a walk in that frenzied state, as your dog is already worked up. And a dog in that state is likely to want to go, go, go once you get outside. Re-set this scene.</p>
<p>Spend a week or two getting out the leash at various times but not going for a walk. Reinforce your dog when he’s near the leash and exhibits calm behavior. Work up to having your dog walk over the leash on the floor with no over-the-top reactions. Then do the same reinforcement as you attach and re-attach the leash several times a day but without heading out for a walk. The reinforced behavior should continue. The idea is to reframe what the leash means to the dog, and now you want it to mean either “Sit” or “Show me calm behavior.” When your dog gives you a calm behavior, then you can attach the leash and start the walk.</p>
<p>Getting your arm nearly yanked out of its socket is no fun at all! Take a step back, and realize your dog isn’t pulling because he is a jerk; he’s pulling because he’s using his intensive sniffing skills or because he walks faster than you or because it’s simply fun for him. Start over by teaching your dog what a leash means in a controlled, boring environment.</p>
<p>I attach the leash to a quality harness on the dog in the living room and toss a delicious treat behind me as I take small steps forward. When Fido catches up and looks up at me wondering if I have more treats, I mark it with an enthusiastic “Yes!” and toss another treat behind me. Repeat inside your home and then move to your back or front yard (or balcony or hallway in an apartment). Once these exercises go smoothly and your dog understands, resume re-training out in public spaces.</p>
<p>Dogs are basically a nose with a body attached. Their <a href="http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/dogs-sense-of-smell-facts">world is nose driven</a> and that’s because it is such an amazingly powerful thing. It may help to remind yourself as your dog is glued to the fire hydrant smelling and smelling the latest pee-mail, that other dogs...</p> <p class="article-info-more"> <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-training/dog-walking-problems-solutions" target="_blank">Click here to read more</a> </p>
