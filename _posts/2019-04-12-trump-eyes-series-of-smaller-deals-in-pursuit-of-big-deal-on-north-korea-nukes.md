  Hoping to revive stalled talks on eliminating North Korea’s nuclear weapons, President Trump told South Korea’s president Thursday that he won’t lift “fair” sanctions on Pyongyang but is willing to consider “smaller deals” such as humanitarian aid for the communist North.
  In his first face-to-face meeting with South Korea’s Moon Jae-in since a failed denuclearization summit in late February, Mr. Trump said he is still aiming for the “big deal” of persuading North Korea’s Kim Jong-un to abandon his weapons programs.
  The big deal is we have to get rid of the nuclear weapons.” The president seemed to reject Mr. Moon’s recent clamoring for easing sanctions and providing North Korea with an “early harvest” of economic relief.
  Mr.
  Moon said Mr. Trump is responsible for “a dramatic turnaround regarding the political situation on the Korean Peninsula.” “Previously, because of the repeated nuclear and missile tests from North Korea, we saw that the military tension at the time had been at its greatest, and we were in a very precarious situation,” Mr.
  Moon told Mr. Trump in the Oval Office.
  “However, since you met Chairman Kim and you initiated personal diplomacy with him, we saw the dramatic, significant reduction of military tension on the Korean Peninsula, and now peace has prevailed.” Although North Korea has agreed to stop testing missiles and nuclear devices, Mr. Kim issued a threat over sanctions.
  “The relationship [with North Korea] is a much different relationship than it was two years ago,” Mr. Trump said, “and certainly [than] during the Obama administration, where nuclear weapons were being tested often, where rockets and missiles were being sent up, in many cases, over Japan.
  Mr. Trump held his first summit with Mr. Kim in Singapore in June after months of increasingly hostile rhetoric on both sides.

<p>Hoping to revive stalled talks on eliminating <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/north-korea/">North Korea</a>’s nuclear weapons, President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/melania-trump/">Trump</a> told <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/south-korea/">South Korea</a>’s president Thursday that he won’t lift “fair” sanctions on Pyongyang but is willing to consider “smaller deals” such as humanitarian aid for the communist North.</p>
<p>In his first face-to-face meeting with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/south-korea/">South Korea</a>’s <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/moon-jae/">Moon Jae</a>-in since a failed denuclearization summit in late February, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/melania-trump/">Mr. Trump</a> said he is still aiming for the “big deal” of persuading <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/north-korea/">North Korea</a>’s <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kim-jong-un/">Kim Jong-un</a> to abandon his weapons programs. Both men said they will pursue more meetings with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kim-jong-un/">Mr. Kim</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/melania-trump/">Mr. Trump</a> said he is discussing “certain humanitarian things” for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/north-korea/">North Korea</a>, such as food aid, to put the fragile negotiations back on track. He and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kim-jong-un/">Mr. Kim</a> left their second summit in Hanoi, Vietnam, without any agreement.</p>
<p>“There are various smaller deals that maybe could happen,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/melania-trump/">Mr. Trump</a> told reporters at the White House. “You could work out, step-by-step, pieces. But at this moment, we’re talking about the big deal. The big deal is we have to get rid of the nuclear weapons.”</p>
<p>The president seemed to reject <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/moon-jae/">Mr. Moon</a>’s recent clamoring for easing sanctions and providing <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/north-korea/">North Korea</a> with an “early harvest” of economic relief. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/melania-trump/">Mr. Trump</a> noted that he rescinded sanctions announced by the Treasury Department in late March, although the administration later said the president stopped a round of economic penalties rather than withdrawing new ones.</p>
<p>“We want sanctions to remain in place,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/melania-trump/">Mr. Trump</a> said. “I had the option of significantly increasing them. I didn’t want to do that because of my relationship with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kim-jong-un/">Kim Jong-un</a>. But I think that sanctions are, right now, at a level that’s a fair level.”</p>
<p>A United Nations report last month found that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/north-korea/">North Korea</a> is using sophisticated techniques to evade U.N. sanctions and is importing crude oil, hacking into foreign banks, increasing coal exports and selling weapons.</p>
<p>Asked whether he supports <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/moon-jae/">Mr. Moon</a>’s efforts to establish inter-Korean commerce, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/melania-trump/">Mr. Trump</a> said, “This isn’t the right time.”</p>
<p>“When the right deal is made, and when the nuclear weapons are gone, I just think that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/north-korea/">North Korea</a> has potential as great as anything I’ve ever seen in terms of potential,” he said.</p>
