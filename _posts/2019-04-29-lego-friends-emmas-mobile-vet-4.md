  Who doesn’t love LEGOs?
  I’ve been a fan of these fun building blocks since I was a kid, and it’s amazing how many choices there are now.
  And if you have a young friend who wants to be a veterinarian someday, Emma’s Mobile Vet is a great way to get her started.
  The set comes with an Emma mini-doll, a dog figure (an adorable Pug named Toffee), van, examination bed, feeding bottle and plate, dog bone, lamp, syringe and grooming brush.
  Recommended for kids aged 4 and older and retails for $9.99.
  For more information, visit shop.lego.com/en-US.
  A cat lover since she was a little girl, she has always had feline friends in her life.
  She and her husband share their Southern California home with their four cats, Agatha, Alastair, Jack and Mathilda, and an ever-changing clowder of foster kittens, all of whom enjoy being testers for cool, new products.
