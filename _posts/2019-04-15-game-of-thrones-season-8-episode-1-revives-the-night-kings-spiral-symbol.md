post_title: '&#8216;Game of Thrones&#8217; Season 8 Episode 1 Revives the Night King&#8217;s Spiral Symbol'
author: Jessica Goldberg
post_excerpt: |
  One of the greatest mysteries surrounding the Night King and the White Walkers returned in Sunday night’s Game of Thrones Season 8 premiere, when we saw the same curious ancient spiral symbol that has served as a motif for their ominous presence since the series’ very beginning.
  Spoilers follow for Game of Thrones Season 8, Episode 1.
  We quickly learn that, per many assumptions and leaks about the episode, the Night King’s army has already ravaged Last Hearth, home to House Umber and the closest piece of civilization south of the Wall.
  “It’s a message from the Night King,” Beric says.
  The castle has been ransacked, but there isn’t a single body beyond Ned Umber.
  One of the episode’s earliest scenes reminded us of Ned Umber’s existence, all so he could suffer this gruesome fate.
  “These are patterns that have mystical significance for the Children of the Forest,” he said.
  “We’re not sure exactly what they signify, but spiral patterns are important in a lot of different cultures in our world, so it makes sense that they would be in this world.” In the first Game of Thrones scene ever, several men of the Night’s Watch see the bodies of Wildlings arranged like the circular symbol.
  In Season 3, we see the body parts of horses arranged like the spiral.
  It would seem these magic symbols are part of the written language used by the Children of the Forest and are directly associated with the White Walkers.

<p>One of the greatest mysteries surrounding the Night King and the White Walkers returned in Sunday night’s <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/54790-game-of-thrones-season-8-episode-1-spoilers-cast-comments-on-the-ending"><em>Game of Thrones</em> Season 8</a> premiere, when we saw the same curious ancient spiral symbol that has served as a motif for their ominous presence since the series’ very beginning. The scene in question, which took place in House Umber, may be a bit confusing if you haven’t read up on the Night King’s spiral recently.</p>
<p>Here’s what you need to know.</p>
<p><strong>Spoilers follow for <em>Game of Thrones</em> Season 8, Episode 1.</strong></p>
<p>Very late in the premiere, we catch up with Tormund and Beric Dondarrion as they enter some snowy building. We quickly learn that, per many assumptions and leaks about the episode, the Night King’s army has already ravaged <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/54599-game-of-thrones-season-8-spoilers-in-episode-1-premiere-leak">Last Hearth</a>, home to House Umber and the closest piece of civilization south of the Wall. They stumble upon Edd, Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch, and soon find poor Ned Umber staked to a wall with a bunch of human limbs pinned around him in a spiral.</p>
<p>“It’s a message from the Night King,” Beric says. The castle has been ransacked, but there isn’t a single body beyond Ned Umber. Rather than add him to the horde of the undead, the Night King left him there, wreathed in spare body parts, as a message.</p>
