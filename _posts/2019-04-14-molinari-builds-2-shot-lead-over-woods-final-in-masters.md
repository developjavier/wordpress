  Molinari played bogey-free for the second straight round at Augusta National and took advantage of the rain-softened course for a 6-under 66, giving the British Open champion a two-shot lead going into a Sunday like no other at the Masters.
  Woods made three straight birdies on the front and finished with three birdies over his last six holes for a 67, his best score at the Masters since the final round in 2011.
  Joining them will be Tony Finau, playing this year on two good ankles after a self-inflicted injury a year ago .
  Molinari was at 13-under 203, two shots ahead of Woods and Finau. "Obviously, he's playing great," Molinari said of Woods.
  Woods has won all 14 of his majors when he had at least a share of the lead going into the final round.
  He was paired with him in the final round at Carnoustie last year, where Woods briefly took the lead and the Italian never flinched, playing bogey-free to capture his first major.
  Molinari, playing in the final group, kept right on rolling.
  It will be an exciting day tomorrow."
  Because of the change in starting times, Finau gets to play alongside Woods -- his golfing hero -- not only at the last group in a major, but at the Masters.

<p><b>By Associated Press</b></p>
<p>AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Francesco Molinari blocked out the buzz from Tiger Woods charging up the leaderboard Saturday at the Masters and produced solid golf that looks spectacular only on the scorecard.</p>
<p>Molinari played bogey-free for the second straight round at Augusta National and took advantage of the rain-softened course for a 6-under 66, giving the British Open champion a two-shot lead going into a Sunday like no other at the Masters.</p>
<p>Because of severe storms in the forecast, the final round will start off hours early, teeing off on both sides and with players in threesomes instead of pairs. Officials hope that speeds up the finish to early afternoon, ahead of the rain.</p>
<p>That puts Woods in the final group of a major for the first time since the 2009 PGA Championship at Hazeltine, where he gave up a two-shot lead on the final day to Y.E. Yang.</p>
<p>Woods made three straight birdies on the front and finished with three birdies over his last six holes for a 67, his best score at the Masters since the final round in 2011. Joining them will be Tony Finau, playing this year on two good ankles after a self-inflicted injury a year ago . He was part of a history-making Saturday as one of three players to shoot 64.</p>
<p>Molinari was at 13-under 203, two shots ahead of Woods and Finau.</p>
<p>"Obviously, he's playing great," Molinari said of Woods. "But a lot of guys are playing great. I wish I only had to worry about him. I think a few more are going to come out tomorrow and try to shoot a low one."</p>
<p>Another shot behind was Brooks Koepka, who has won three of the last six majors and had a 69 despite four bogeys.</p>
<p>Woods has won all 14 of his majors when he had at least a share of the lead going into the final round. He brings momentum to this major, having contended in the last two.</p>
