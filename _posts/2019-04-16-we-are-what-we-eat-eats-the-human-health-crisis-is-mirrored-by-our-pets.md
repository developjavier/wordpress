post_title: 'We Are What We Eat Eats: The Human Health Crisis is Mirrored by our Pets'

post_excerpt: |
  If you eat animal products, and most of our dogs and cats do, then we have to take into account what our food animals are fed.
  Unfortunately for our beloved furry companions, they are suffering the same fate of a gradual chronic decline in health for many of the same reasons.
  Our food supply is now controlled by a few large corporations who have selected the food we eat, and that of our pets, with profit margin and shelf life as two of the most important factors.
  This has resulted in drastic health consequences for both people and their companion animals.
  Such intensive farming of field after field of a single crop creates a larger pest problem requiring more frequent spraying with pesticides.
  If you eat animal products, and most of our dogs and cats do, then we have to take into account what our food animals are fed.
  For people, I think both issues are pretty common.
  Everyone, people and their pets, should avail themselves of these wonderfully helpful substances.
  The supplement Digestive Enzymes & Probiotics by The Pet Health & Nutrition Center is formulated with a heavy emphasis on proteases and peptidase enzymes to meet the needs of our dogs and cats.
  It is simple really, eat more whole, unprocessed, organically or sustainably grown food.

<p>A half hour spent in front of your TV at night is enough to realize that Americans are suffering from a plethora of health issues. It seems like every other commercial is either for a prescription drug, or over-the-counter relief from some health issue. Many people, of all age groups, seem to have a lineup of medications which they take daily. It appears that most people seem to believe this is normal; I can assure you it is not.</p>
<p>A normal, healthy body should go through life with a stable level of health, barring the occasional cold or flu. As we come closer to the end of our lives, we should have a steep decline in health followed by death. This would be a more natural course of events, as opposed to this gradual decline in health over years, which eventually ends in the same place, but with far more suffering in the interim. Unfortunately for our beloved furry companions, they are suffering the same fate of a gradual chronic decline in health for many of the same reasons.</p>
<p>As our country moved away from small independent farms, in favor of large corporately owned operations, the quality and diversity of the food supply decreased drastically. Our food supply is now controlled by a few large corporations who have selected the food we eat, and that of our pets, with profit margin and shelf life as two of the most important factors.</p>
<p>This has resulted in drastic health consequences for both people and their companion animals. Corn, wheat, and soy are the most abundantly farmed crops, and some derivative of one or more of these appear in most, if not all, processed food. Such intensive farming of field after field of a single crop creates a larger pest problem requiring more frequent spraying with...</p> <p class="article-info-more"> <a href="https://www.dogingtonpost.com/we-are-what-we-eat-eats-the-human-health-crisis-is-mirrored-by-our-pets/" target="_blank">Click here to read more</a> </p>
