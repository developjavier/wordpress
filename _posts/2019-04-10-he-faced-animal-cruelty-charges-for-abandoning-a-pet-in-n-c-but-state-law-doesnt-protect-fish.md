  State prosecutors combed animal cruelty statutes while Hinson, 53, posted a $4,000 bond for release.
  Laws protect dogs, roosters, rabbits, baby chicks and other fowl specifically, but broadly, the state defines animals as “every living vertebrate in the classes Amphibia, Reptilia, Aves, and Mammalia except human beings.” There is one glaring exception, New Hanover County District Attorney Ben David said.
  Hinson could not be reached for comment.

<p>Michael Ray Hinson was the one who got away, prosecutors announced Tuesday.</p>
<p>Hinson was charged April 4 with multiple counts of misdemeanor animal cruelty after he vacated a home last month in Wilmington, N.C. He left behind a pet oscar fish that was discovered malnourished, diseased and living in “deplorable” conditions.</p>
<p>State prosecutors combed animal cruelty statutes while Hinson, 53, posted a $4,000 bond for release.</p>
<p>Laws protect dogs, roosters, rabbits, baby chicks and other fowl specifically, but broadly, the <a href="https://www.ncleg.net/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/ByArticle/Chapter_14/Article_47.pdf">state defines animals</a> as “every living vertebrate in the classes Amphibia, Reptilia, Aves, and Mammalia except human beings.”</p>
<p>There is one glaring exception, New Hanover County District Attorney Ben David said.</p>
<p>Fish, which are the only vertebrates not included in the law.</p>
<p>David dropped charges of animal cruelty and abandonment against Hinson, though he criticized the alleged behavior that endangered the fish.</p>
<p>“We take a very dim view of anyone who would abuse any creature great or small and appreciate [animal services] enforcement of the laws to protect vulnerable animals,” David said in a statement.</p>
<p>Hinson could not be reached for comment.</p>
