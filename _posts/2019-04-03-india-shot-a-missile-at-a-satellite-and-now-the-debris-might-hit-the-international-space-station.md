  You can’t exactly see it from down here on Earth, but there’s a whole lot of junk floating around in the space around our planet.
  Now, thanks to a hilariously bad decision by India, there’s even more of it.
  In a new test of its growing space might, India decided to launch a missile to shoot down one of its own satellites.
  The country’s thinking was that the demonstration would be a message to the world that India is now “a major space power.” In reality the test created hundreds of pieces of space debris that now threaten the safety of future missions, and might even pose a danger to astronauts aboard the International Space Station.
  Nice one.
  NASA and other space groups were quick to track the debris created by the missile and subsequent destruction of the satellite.
  The satellite itself was in low orbit, but the blast pushed many pieces of debris into and above the orbit of the ISS.
  The majority of the risk to ISS inhabitants will peak over the next ten days, NASA says.
  After that point much of the debris will have fallen back to Earth, but some of it will remain indefinitely.

The vast majority of it is man-made, including pieces of satellites, entire defunct spacecraft, and bits and pieces of past space missions.
