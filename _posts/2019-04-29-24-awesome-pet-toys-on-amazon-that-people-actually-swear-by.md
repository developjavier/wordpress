<p><b>Promising review:</b> “Purchased for a 10 lb pup who loves toys and it was a hit. She was into it immediately and eventually carried it in the other room so she could play without us bothering her. We’ve had it for months and she still likes it. She carries the squirrels around with her (very cute). All the pieces have held together really well and all the squeakers still work.” —<a data-skimlinks-tracking="4968658" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEE24CXFCSQ5PX74MKATTKNJTRIQ?tag=bfheather-20&amp;ascsubtag=4968658%2C2%2C28%2Cmobile_web%2C0%2C0">Kylie</a></p>

<p>I have an 80-pound golden retriever — and he can really tear into toys like it’s nobody’s business. However he (and thousands of dogs all over the country) can’t destroy this Kong Extreme Dog Toy. This toy is so amazing that 6,251 Amazon customers have given it a <a data-amzn-asin="B0002AR0II" data-skimlinks-tracking="4968658" href="https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0002AR0II?tag=bfheather-20&amp;ascsubtag=4968658%2C3%2C28%2Cmobile_web%2C0%2C0">five-star review</a>!</p>
<p><b>Promising review:</b> “Well, my adolescent dog is finally old enough that he can destroy most dog toys out there. People rave about Kongs for good reason! He doesn’t seem to be able to chew through these toys, thank goodness! We’re a busy family, so I use these Kong Extremes to keep him busy and out of my hair. I mix approximately half a can of wet dog food with water to make a soupy concoction. Then I mix in some dry kibble and fill the kong with this moistened, extra-tasty dog food. Then I freeze it. A frozen filled Kong will keep my dog (approx 60 lbs) busy for at least an hour.” —<a data-skimlinks-tracking="4968658" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHDFKMWEMOBUMFHRPYC7ID74Q5NA?tag=bfheather-20&amp;ascsubtag=4968658%2C3%2C28%2Cmobile_web%2C0%2C0">Cholla Cactus</a></p>

<p>The product review photos of this precious item have me squealing — they are so damn cute! This stuffed animal features a realistic pulsing heartbeat and a battery-operated heart source that will help keep your uptight dog or cat calm and collected.</p>
<p><b>Promising review:</b> “My pup was separated from her mother way too early and has crazy separation anxiety. I opened this as soon as I got it and she instantaneously passed out on top of it.

<p>This is a seriously intense puzzle! It challenges dogs and cats to open drawers with the help of loops and sliders, and the difficulty only goes up from there. It will definitely keep your pet entertained (and probably everyone else in your home as well).</p>
<p><b>Promising review:</b> “As a pet parent to three rescues and a foster, we bought a few dog puzzles of various levels to see what would best engage and entertain them. <b>This has been the pack favorite and ours as we can easily adapt it to each dog’s level of skill.</b> We appreciate how well made it is and would recommend it highly. Some reviews expressed concerns over dogs with larger snouts being unable to access treats in these toys. We have a Labrador, pit mix (like a miniature pit), Baseniji mix, and German shepherd mix. They range in size from about 25 lbs to 75 lbs and have all enjoyed this toy!” —<a data-skimlinks-tracking="4968658" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGORMXG4TFQD6SJPF2BHEORSU4SQ?tag=bfheather-20&amp;ascsubtag=4968658%2C5%2C28%2Cmobile_web%2C0%2C0">Liz Cooper</a></p>

<p>This frisbee is like no other — it’s lightweight, buoyant in water, easy to clean, and gentle on dogs’ mouths. What more could you want in a toy?</p>
<p><b>Promising review:</b> “This is my dog’s favorite thing EVER. He’s a rowdy boxer/Lab boy who loves to tug, and these Frisbees hold up really well. He holds onto it with both his little paws so no one can take it away. I have to replace them every couple months after continuous play. Of all the toys he has, this is always number one. <b>It’s his most prized thing and he loves to show it off and dance around with it.</b> Seeing him that happy is definitely worth it!” —<a data-skimlinks-tracking="4968658" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGK3UFOYKUUF3UVVSD3R7WSGQTRA?tag=bfheather-20&amp;ascsubtag=4968658%2C6%2C28%2Cmobile_web%2C0%2C0">Super Awesome</a></p>

<p>Looking for a versatile toy sure to have your pup jumping for joy? This is it, my friends! This breathable rubber ball is ideal for playing fetch, tossing, and tugging — it’s everything your dog wants in a toy!</p>
<p><b>Promising review:</b> “I was searching for a great toy for my pit bull (8 months olds) and decided on this toy. He is a chewer, and destroys anything he can rip apart. I went with the green x-large size ball, and he just loves it. It has some weight to it, and he still picks it up and runs around with it with ease. I try to only let him play with it while supervised, and so far it is still in one piece after a month now! When you throw it, it rolls, does not bounce.” —<a data-skimlinks-tracking="4968658" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH3SPAVMI2V7B2YJEWP5ZJG27ZBQ?tag=bfheather-20&amp;ascsubtag=4968658%2C7%2C28%2Cmobile_web%2C0%2C0">DZ</a></p>

<p>Not only will this cat condo give your kitty a fun place to hide/climb/hang out in, but it will add some much-needed greenery to your home. Big win!</p>
<p><b>Promising review:</b> “At first, our cat wouldn’t climb onto it, even with coaxing her with treats and catnip. We think it might have had a smell or something about it from the container. But now, it’s her FAVORITE part of the house, she’s on it all the time! It was pretty easy to assemble and is a really cool cat tree. We didn’t want a carpet tree, and the extra foliage fits nicely in our house!” —<a data-skimlinks-tracking="4968658" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGVBWRX7WLPOWPUDUBY2WQBH3NLA?tag=bfheather-20&amp;ascsubtag=4968658%2C8%2C28%2Cmobile_web%2C0%2C0">The Queen of Anneland</a></p>

<p>I openly admit to loving my dog more than any other living being in my life. I’m sure many of you feel the same, so you know how heartbreaking it is when your pup is begging for a game of fetch but you’re simply too caught up in something else to stop and play with them. This gadget is about to solve that problem — see ya, guilt!</p>
<p><b>Promising review:</b> “My dogs love it! I have two small dogs and when it is too cold or wet outside and they can’t go out, this is how we play. I aim the launcher toward the hallway and they chase after it and bring ball back to me every time. I use two balls and as one is brought to me, I launch the next. Keeps them busy and tires them out so I get a little peace and quiet on cold or rainy days. Still working on getting dogs to drop the ball into machine but it works out great. <b>I purchased <a data-amzn-asin="B071HGXP67" data-skimlinks-tracking="4968658" href="https://amzn.to/2URUcJy">Kong Air Balls</a> in extra small-size as replacements when other balls are chewed or lost.</b> They are cheaper to replace and work well with the machine and are a bit sturdier.” —<a data-skimlinks-tracking="4968658" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE6HUVQ3JCPZXBDZUJF7FRYALKNQ?tag=bfheather-20&amp;ascsubtag=4968658%2C9%2C28%2Cmobile_web%2C0%2C0">Medinagirl</a></p>

<p>I do not have the best throwing arm — and my golden retriever, Luke, always looks at me like, “R U KIDDING?” when I throw him his favorite tennis ball. Luckily for me, the Chuckit! ball launcher exists to help me (and him) have a better game of fetch.</p>
<p><b>Promising review:</b> “Without these launchers I would need my arms amputated. They are incredibly useful. <b>You don’t have to touch slobbery balls or risk damaging your arm from throwing too much.</b> The 25- or 26-inch lengths are the ones that most people probably want. You don’t have to bend all the way over to reload. These make playing fetch so much easier and more enjoyable for both me and my fetching-obsessed golden retriever.” —<a data-skimlinks-tracking="4968658" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHC5OBKR7HE3TA7LCSBMA2IIZYQQ?tag=bfheather-20&amp;ascsubtag=4968658%2C10%2C28%2Cmobile_web%2C0%2C0">RG</a></p>
