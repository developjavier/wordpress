post_title: 'Measles outbreak: How doctors can change anti-vaccine minds'

  When Theresa Ward had her first child 14 years ago, the Pittsburgh mom followed the pediatrician’s recommendations and fully vaccinated her son on schedule.
  Ward, now 30, began refusing booster shots for the toddler and when she later had two more children, they went unvaccinated.
  In the midst of the measles spread in the U.S., doctors and public health workers are learning on the fly what works, and what doesn’t, when it comes to communicating with vaccine-hesitant parents and communities.
  After an outbreak of measles in Rockland county, New York, local officials issued a temporary 30-day ban on unvaccinated children from public gathering spaces.
  It's too soon to know if public bans like Rockland’s are effective in increasing vaccination rates, Omer said.
  Wiesman declined to specifically comment on Rockland’s ban, but said that if public health were adequately funded in the U.S., there would be no need for such orders.
  Nuurali also actively tried to reach families of unvaccinated children.
  “The thing that worked for us was when we listened.” With the efforts of the Minnesota Department of Health, Minnesota Children’s hospital, Nuurali and others, Somali children under age 6 saw a 262 percent uptick in MMR shots from April to August 2017 — the length of the measles outbreak — compared to the year before.
  She talked with a pediatrician she had trusted for years, and who had put in the time to answer her questions.
  “We found a pediatrician that would not [mandate shots] and just gave me the freedom to process it and have an open conversation about vaccination,” she said.

<p>But when the boy turned 3, Ward began to worry about risks associated with vaccines, like fever or rare, but serious allergic reactions. She also <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/another-study-finds-no-link-between-autism-measles-mumps-rubella-n979176">feared autism</a>. Ward, now 30, began refusing booster shots for the toddler and when she later had two more children, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/thousands-young-us-children-get-no-vaccines-survey-finds-n919166">they went unvaccinated.</a></p>
<p>“I didn’t feel urgency to make a choice to have them vaccinated because of the environment we live in,” Ward explained. “We’re in the U.S. and we live in Pittsburgh where we have access to the best hospitals if there were some disease.”</p>
<p>Because she refused vaccination, several pediatricians in the area turned her away, concerned about the risk it could pose to their other very young patients. Ward finally landed at a pediatrician’s office in East Pittsburgh that didn’t mandate vaccinations for patients. Instead, over the course of several years, the doctor maintained an open dialogue with Ward.</p>
<p>That doctor’s patience paid off.</p>

<p>In 2016, after a 10-day trip to India, Ward’s perspective on vaccines began to change again. Seeing how people suffered from preventable diseases, as well as the lack of access to basic health care, Ward realized her internal conflict about vaccines was self-centered.</p>
<p>“We have a responsibility for the greater good of the world,” Ward said. When she returned from India, she went straight to her pediatrician to get her three children up to date on their shots. When her fourth child was born, she vaccinated him on schedule.</p>
<p>While the overwhelming majority of Americans choose to have their children vaccinated, the number of <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/vaccine-rates-are-so-are-refusals-n838811">children who go completely unvaccinated</a> is rising. The most recent estimate from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that in 2017, 1.3 percent of toddlers <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/mm6740a4.htm">haven’t had a single shot</a>, more than quadruple the 0.3 percent rate in 2001.</p>
<p>Ward’s story hints at the time and intensity of care that may be required to counsel a hesitant parent about vaccines. But as <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/uc-davis-medical-center-warns-200-people-potential-measles-exposure-n991166">outbreaks of measles</a> continue in the U.S., doctors and public health experts are realizing that there is a lot they don’t know about the most effective methods to counteract the anti-vaccine movement.</p>
<p>Vaccine safety and effectiveness have been studied for decades, but research on how to talk about vaccines, and how to increase vaccine acceptance, is still in its infancy. In the midst of the measles spread in the U.S., doctors and public health workers are learning on the fly what works, and what doesn’t, when it comes to communicating with vaccine-hesitant parents and communities.</p>

<p>“These outbreaks are showing us that we’re behind the curve” when it comes to vaccine communication research, said Washington Department of Health secretary John Wiesman. “There’s no reason people should be getting sick from vaccine preventable diseases.”</p>
<p>And the little that is known has yet to “scale up,” or spread to every single doctor’s office and local public health department, said epidemiologist Dr. Saad Omer, a vaccine and infectious-disease expert at Emory University in...</p> <p class="article-info-more"> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/measles-outbreak-how-doctors-can-change-anti-vaccine-minds-n991491" target="_blank">Click here to read more</a> </p>
