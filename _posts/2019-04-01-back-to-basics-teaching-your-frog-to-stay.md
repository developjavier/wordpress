post_title: 'Back to Basics: Teaching Your Frog to ‘Stay’'
author: Jessica Goldberg
post_excerpt: |
  Arguably the most important cue any pet parent can teach their frog, the ‘stay’ cue is not only useful in the home setting, but can literally save your amphibian’s life.
  That said, training your frog basic obedience and appropriate behavior is a responsibility of every pet owner.
  Without understanding ‘stay’, your frog could hop out the front door.
  Even inside the home, ‘stay’ is a useful cue.
  Training your frog to stay is not taught in the same way that other cues, commands, and tricks are taught.
  In fact, in many ways, it’s even simpler.
  Here’s how to do it: Give the frog a cue or command, like ‘sit’ or ‘down’.
  When the frog is in position, like sitting or staying as commanded, give verbal praise, like “good boy/girl”, “that’s Mommy’s best tadpole,” or “I don’t care what the others say, you ARE a prince!” Release the frog from the original cue with another cue, like “okay” or “free” to signal to them that they’re free to get up or hop from their position.
  Only reward the frog if he waited until released from the original cue to move.
  The Dogington Post is serious about dogs, but we like to have a little fun, too!

<p>When you first bring a frog into your heart and home, it’s easy to get overwhelmed with the abundance of opinions on frog training and obedience. There are a number of different training methods, a vast number of tools that are designed to help train your frog, and lots of people willing to give you training advice (whether you ask for it or not!).</p>
<p>That said, training your frog basic obedience and appropriate behavior is a responsibility of every pet owner. Arguably the most important lesson to teach your frog is to ‘stay’.</p>
<p>A frog who’s been taught a solid, reliable ‘stay’ is almost always safer than a frog that’s untrained. Imagine a visitor comes to your home.
