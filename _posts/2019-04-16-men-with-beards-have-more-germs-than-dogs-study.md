  That’s because a new study suggests that bearded guys actually have more germs than a dog’s fur.
  Researchers at the Hirslanden Clinic near Zurich, Switzerland, wanted to determine whether evaluating humans and dogs in the same MRI scanner would be hygienic.
  The researchers also compared the extent of bacterial contamination of an MRI scanner used by both dogs and humans with two other MRI scanners used exclusively by humans.
  In fact, seven of the men had so much beard bacteria they were at risk of getting sick, according to the BBC.
  The jointly used scanner also had significantly lower bacteria counts than the scanners used only by humans.
  The study was published in February but went viral earlier this week.
  However, some beard buffs are making cutting remarks about the study.
  Keith Flett, founder of the pro-hirsute Beard Liberation Front, cast doubt on the report to the Daily Mail.
