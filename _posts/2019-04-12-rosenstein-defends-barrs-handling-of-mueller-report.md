  Rosenstein defends Barr’s handling of
  Mueller report

  “He’s being as forthcoming as he can, and so this notion that he’s trying to mislead people, I think is just completely bizarre,” Rosenstein said in the interview.

  However, Mueller declined to reach a conclusion on whether the president obstructed justice.
  Barr and Rosenstein then decided they could not make a criminal case that the president obstructed justice.

Mueller III concluded the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, Rosenstein tried to tamp down criticisms of Barr’s handling of the report and the time it is taking him to release it.</p>
