  Get Fido His Own Bed First thing's first, your dog will need his own bed if you're not going to let him sleep in yours.
  You also need to give your dog time to get used to his new bed before expecting him to sleep on it all night.
  If you let your dog sleep in your bed for the first night or two, you're going to have a much harder time learning how to keep dog off bed.
  When you want your dog to lie on his own bed, give the command and place him on his dog bed.
  As he gradually begins to spend more time on his bed, be sure to praise him for doing what you want him to do.
  It's going to take a while, but as long as you use the same command and a firm voice, your pup will begin to understand what you want.
  The best thing you can do when learning how to keep dog off bed is to ignore the whining and stick to your training method.
  No one likes staying up late to get their dog settled in on his own bed, and it stinks to wake up tired in the morning because you were up half the night with a whining pooch.
  Make His Bed Enticing Placing a toy or chew on your dog's bed may give him a reason to stay there.
  Keep Him Off All Furniture Keeping your dog off of all furniture in your home will make it much easier when you're trying to teach him to stay off of your bed.

<p>There is nothing wrong with having your dog sleep in your bed. In fact, a majority of pet owners like having their pooch snuggle in bed with them. However, some owners complain that they don't sleep as well with their pup in their bed. If you fall into this second category, learning <strong>how to keep dog off bed</strong> is going to be necessary for you to get a good night's rest.</p>
<p>According to a recent <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2002/02/020215070932.htm">Mayo Clinic study</a>, 53% of pets owners were experiencing some kind of sleep disruption from sleeping with their pets every night. Likewise, 35% of them were explicitly bothered by their pup barking in his sleep. This common sleep disorder in animals occurs depending on the breed, the amount of activity they have during the day and the personality of the animal.</p>
<p>Like humans, dogs have their own unique sleeping habits. While some dogs enjoy sleeping on their side, others lie on their back with their paws stretched out. Some dogs like to “nest” or sleep underneath blankets.</p>
<p>If you've provided your dog with a <a href="https://topdogtips.com/best-dog-bed/">high quality pet bed</a> but he still jumps up to sleep with you, this habit can be changed. With a little time and patience (and a lot of praise and treats), your dog can be taught to sleep in his own bed. You may even be surprised to find that he enjoys having his own space more than he likes sleeping with you.</p>
<h2><strong>How To Keep Dog Off Bed</strong><br>
<em>in 10 simple steps</em></h2>
<h3><strong>1. Get Fido His Own Bed</strong></h3>
<p>First thing's first, your dog will need his own bed if you're not going to let him sleep in yours. <a href="https://topdogtips.com/how-to-choose-the-best-pet-bed-for-your-dog/">Choose a dog bed</a> that fits your dog's sleeping style. You'll also need to check the measurements to ensure the bed will be big enough for your dog to stretch out and relax.</p>
<p>You also need to give your dog time to get used to his new bed before expecting him to sleep on it all night. Dogs are suspicious of new things. New things smell different, and that means danger to your dog.</p>
<p>Dogs explore the world around them with their noses. Things that smell different cannot be trusted – at least not until Fido gets used to the new smell. If your dog doesn't trust his new bed, he isn't going to want to spend all night lying on it.</p>
<p>At first, put the bed in an area where your dog spends a lot of time. After a few days, the bed will start to absorb the smells of your home, your human family members and your pets. With time and patience, your dog will start spending more time on the bed. Eventually, he'll be comfortable taking naps or sleeping through the night on his comfy new resting spot.</p>
