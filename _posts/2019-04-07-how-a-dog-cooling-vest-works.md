  That means that they don’t sweat as much as humans and can’t release the excess heat as we do.
  When Do You Need a Dog Cooling Vest?
  Dogs pant to keep themselves as cool as possible, but when the temperature is extremely high that might not be enough to keep your pooch safe from heat exhaustion.
  Make sure that your canine always has access to shade in hot weather, as well as plenty of fresh drinking water to keep him hydrated.
  Dog cooling vests work on the principle of evaporation, much like the human body does to stay cool when our sweat evaporates and disposes of the excess heat.
  When it evaporates, the dog’s body heat evaporates with it.
  Cooling vests are very effective in cooling your pooch because they can pull out the excess body heat all day long.
  That is why a combination of a cooling vest and a cooling collar is the best way to keep your dog safe in hot temperatures.
  These pouches keep a dog’s body temperature down and last for around 2 hours.
  First, put the vest in a bucket of cool water and let it soak for a few minutes.

<p><strong>One of the must-have accessories for dogs</strong> during the summer is something that will keep them cooler, and a cooling vest is one of the better options. Just like us, dogs also feel the effects of heat and can suffer from heat stroke or heat exhaustion. In fact, dogs are even more susceptible to heat problems since they have only a few sweat glands. That means that they don’t sweat as much as humans and can’t release the excess heat as we do.</p>
