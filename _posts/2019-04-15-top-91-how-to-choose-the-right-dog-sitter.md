post_excerpt: |
  Pet sitters perform countless jobs for pet parents.
  You surely know that they can watch your pets for you while you are out of town, but did you know they might also get your mail, water your plants and keep an eye on your home?
  Many pet sitters are also available for daily pet visits, not just overnight stays.
  All pet sitters offer different services, and it’s important that you choose the sitter that will be right for you and your pet.
  Laura Vorreyer is an entrepreneur who pioneered the dog walking business in Hollywood more than 15 years ago.
  She has grown her business substantially to include many different dog walking and pet sitting services.
  And now, she is the author of The Pet Sitter’s Tale.
  Laura published a book about her experience as a Hollywood pet sitter, and she’s sharing some of these experiences with me in this podcast.
