  US Soldier Fights to Bring Puppy Dragged
  by Rope Out of War-Torn Afghanistan

post_excerpt: |
  A US Soldier stationed in Afghanistan is desperately hoping to bring a puppy he bonded with after rescuing her from abuse.
  “We understand his concerns in having to leave her in a place that is very hostile toward dogs, so we are doing everything we can to help make his wish come true and bring the dog to the United States.” It’s difficult enough for a soldier to spend time in a war zone, with blasts and danger in every direction.
  But when you add in a puppy that has no idea what is going on, and it falls into the hands of the opposition, it’s a life of cruelty and abuse, often leading to death.
  She then became a part of their family, and over time, strong bonds have been created.
  To help make it possible for Timothy bring Misha back to the U.S. with him, Paws of War has enlisted the help of Nowzad Dogs, a charity that helps rescue the animals in Afghanistan.
  Through the Mission Misha campaign, they are seeking donations from the community in order to help make the transport possible.
  “I am desperately trying to bring this loving fur baby back to my home in Georgia, where she will live a quiet life away from this war-torn country,” says Timothy Boyd.
  “I appreciate any and all assistance that people can provide in helping to make Mission Misha a successful operation.

<p><strong>NESCONSET, New York – (April 25, 2019)</strong> – Timothy Boyd is a U.S. soldier stationed in war-torn Afghanistan. He will soon be heading back to his hometown of Dallas, Georgia. He desperately wants to bring back Misha, a puppy he saved and has cared for during his stay there. If he has to leave her behind, her fate like so many others, will be certain death. He has reached out to Paws of War pleading for assistance in transporting the Misha to America, so he can keep her and let her live out her days in a safe country with those who love her.</p>
<p>“We can’t stand by and let this dog fall back into the hands of cruel people. There has been a fantastic and lasting bond created between Misha and Timothy,” explains Robert Misseri, co-founder of Paws of War. “We understand his concerns in having to leave her in a place that is very hostile toward dogs, so we are doing everything we can to help make his wish come true and bring the dog to the United States.”</p>
