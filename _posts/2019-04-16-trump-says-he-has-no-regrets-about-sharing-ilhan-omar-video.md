  Trump says he has no regrets about
  sharing Ilhan Omar video

post_excerpt: |
  President Trump said he has no regrets about sharing an incendiary video of Rep. Ilhan Omar and called her “extremely unpatriotic and extremely disrespectful to our country,” as the freshman lawmaker claimed an uptick in threats to her life.
  “No, not at all,” Trump said.
  “Look, she’s been very disrespectful to this country.
  It’s unfortunate.
  I think she’s extremely unpatriotic and extremely disrespectful to our country.” Omar, one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress and the first to wear a hijab, has drawn criticism from conservatives for a speech last month in which, they say, she downplayed the 2001 terrorist attacks.
  She was at the center of an earlier controversy over tweets and a speech criticizing the pro-Israel lobby, AIPAC, that some lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, found to be anti-Semitic.
  But that hasn’t stemmed the vitriol directed at Omar.
  Even a Trump official mocked the death threats to Omar, which only incited more threats.
  They’re not death threats.

<p>Trump made his comments on Monday to local television station KSTP during a trip to Minnesota for an event focused on taxes. He was asked if he had any regrets about a Friday tweet that included video of Omar (D-Minn.) spliced with images of the twin towers falling on Sept. 11, 2001, in the aftermath of terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>“No, not at all,” Trump said. “Look, she’s been very disrespectful to this country. She’s been very disrespectful, frankly, to Israel. She is somebody that doesn’t really understand, I think life, real life, what it’s all about. It’s unfortunate. She’s got a way about her that’s very, very bad I think for our country. I think she’s extremely unpatriotic and extremely disrespectful to our country.”</p>
