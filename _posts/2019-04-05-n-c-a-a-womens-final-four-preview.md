  1 seed, returns to the Final Four for the first time since winning the national title in 2012, and it has been a breeze to get here.
  This is the first trip to the Final Four for Oregon, a second seed, and it has been a fun one given the Ducks’ spread-the-floor, pick-and-roll style of play.
  Notre Dame (34-3) vs. Connecticut (35-2), 9 p.m.
  The best rivalry in the women’s game will play out for the 50th time over all and for the eighth time in the Final Four.
  Last year, Notre Dame knocked off UConn in overtime in the national semifinals, but the Huskies won a regular-season matchup, 89-71, in December.
  “We used to have that with Tennessee.
  Now we have it with Notre Dame.
  I think it’s cool.
  I think they’re the best team in the country.
  But I don’t think anybody else, I think, can match Notre Dame when they’re playing their A game.

<h2>Baylor (35-1) vs. Oregon (33-4), 7 p.m.</h2>
<p>Baylor, a No. 1 seed, returns to the Final Four for the first time since winning the national title in 2012, and it has been a breeze to get here. The Lady Bears rolled over their tournament opponents by an average margin of 38.2 points behind the nation’s best defense and the powerhouse duo of 6-foot-7 Kalani Brown and 6-4 Lauren Cox. This is the first trip to the Final Four for Oregon, a second seed, and it has been a fun one given the Ducks’ spread-the-floor, pick-and-roll style of play.
