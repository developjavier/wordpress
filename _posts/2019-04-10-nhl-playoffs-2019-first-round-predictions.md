  Also on Wednesday: the St. Louis Blues at the Winnipeg Jets (8 p.m., NHL Network); the Dallas Stars at the Nashville Predators (9:30 p.m., USA) and the Vegas Golden Knights at the San Jose Sharks (10:30 p.m., NBCSN).
  The Maple Leafs have a top-five offense with seven 20-goal scorers.
  That's as many series wins as the Capitals have had over the last nine seasons.
  Allen: Penguins in 7: The Islanders are the NHL's No.
  While there are some questions regarding who exactly the goalie will be, this team is still the only squad outside the Lightning to finish in the top 10 in both goals for and against.
  The Sharks are a dangerous offensive team, but they give up too many goals to be effective in the playoffs.
  Did not end the season strong, but Marc-Andre Fleury should be well-rested and his team, now with Mark Stone, will be looking to win one more series than last year when they lost in the Final.
  Brehm: Sharks in 7.
  Goalie Ben Bishop – the NHL's save percentage leader – should be able to steal some games for the Stars, but they lack the Predators' overall depth.
  Allen: Blues in 7: The Jets boast more talent, but the Blues have played at a higher level than the Jets for a while.

<p>USA TODAY Sports’ NHL staff makes its predictions for the first round.</p>
<h2>EASTERN CONFERENCE</h2>
<h3><strong>(1) TAMPA BAY LIGHTNING VS. (WC2) COLUMBUS BLUE JACKETS</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Kevin Allen: Lightning in 4</strong>: The Blue Jackets' effort to make the playoffs should be applauded. But their trade deadline boldness only earned them the opportunity to be humbled by the 62-win Lightning in the first round of the playoffs.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy Hascup: Lightning in 5.</strong> There is no better way for Sergei Bobrovsky to change the narrative of his playoff performances (.891 save percentage in 24 games). But the Lightning are too good and too deep.</p>
<p><strong>Mike Brehm: Lightning in 5.</strong> The Lightning dominated the Blue Jackets in the regular season and the Blue Jackets have never won a playoff series. Those trends will continue, and the Blue Jackets could look very different next season.</p>
<p><strong>Jace Evans: Lightning in 5.</strong> The Blue Jackets' all-in effort before the trade deadline appears to have produced mixed results. That failure to find another gear sees them slotted into a matchup with one of the great regular-season teams in NHL history.</p>
<h3><strong>(2) BOSTON BRUINS VS. (3) TORONTO MAPLE LEAFS</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Allen: Maple Leafs in 6</strong>: Everyone is writing off the Maple Leafs. But let's not forget they have John Tavares, Auston Matthews and Mitch Marner. Look for goalie Frederik Andersen to be the difference.</p>
<p><strong>Hascup: Bruins in 7.</strong> Might be the most entertaining first-round series, and, yes, a repeat of their last two playoffs matchups results.</p>
<p><strong>Brehm: Bruins in 7.</strong> The Bruins were playing much better down the stretch and could end this earlier, but these teams' last two playoff meetings lasted seven games, so why not again? Maybe even the Bruins will have another big third period to make the difference.</p>
<p><strong>Evans: Bruins in 7.</strong> The Bruins might have the best line in hockey. The Maple Leafs have a top-five offense with seven 20-goal scorers. There's little that separates these teams on the ice, but the Bruins hold home ice and the mental edge after last year.</p>

<h2><strong>(1) WASHINGTON CAPITALS VS. (WC1) CAROLINA HURRICANES</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Allen: Capitals in 6.</strong> Want to believe in the 'Canes but the Capitals were a playoff beast just 10 months ago. The Caps have the edge in every category.</p>
<p><strong>Hascup: Capitals in 5.</strong> Washington beat Carolina in all four matchups this season. It wouldn't be surprising to see the Capitals win a second consecutive Stanley Cup, while the Hurricanes are still too inexperienced.</p>
<p><strong>Brehm: Capitals in 5.</strong> Odd fact: The Hurricanes have three playoff appearances this century, yet they have won nine series. That's as many series wins as the Capitals have had over the last nine seasons. But the Capitals...</p> <p class="article-info-more"> <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nhl/2019/04/10/nhl-playoffs-first-round-predictions/3393667002/" target="_blank">Click here to read more</a> </p>
