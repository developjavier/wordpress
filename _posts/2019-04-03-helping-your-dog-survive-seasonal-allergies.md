  Spring is finally upon us!

  This condition normally results in Fido’s skin becoming extremely itchy.
  To relieve the itchiness, your dog will scratch himself excessively, and chew or bite certain parts of his body.
  He might even rub himself against the carpet, furniture, or wall.

  Other symptoms can include ear infection, respiratory symptoms like watery eyes, sneezing, and runny nose, and generalized redness.
