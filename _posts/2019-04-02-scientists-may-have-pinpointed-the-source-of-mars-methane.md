  Scientists May Have Pinpointed the
  Source of Mars’ Methane

post_excerpt: |
  This was a significant finding — methane has been periodically detected on Mars at various points, but the gas has always vanished thereafter.
  More interestingly, we may also have found the source.
  Despite the fact that much of Earth’s methane is produced biologically, biological sources for Mars’ methane were always unlikely.
  Comparing the data from Curiosity with the data from Mars Express, the team was able to determine that the methane in question probably came from a ground release some distance from Curiosity’s location at Gale Crater.
  After considering when the release began and the likely size, the scientists were able to create a likely grid for the emissions.
  Current thinking is that a break in the Martian permafrost allowed for a significant release of methane gas.
  This investigation highlights one of the gaps in our knowledge of Mars.
  While we’re familiar with the planet’s surface at this point, knowledge of its interior is lacking.
  Few things would be.

<p>Back in 2013, NASA’s Mars probe Curiosity reported detecting methane on Mars. This was a significant finding — methane has been periodically detected on Mars at various points, but the gas has always vanished thereafter. Long periods of time have passed without any methane being detected in the atmosphere at all.</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://www.geek.com/news/scientists-discover-potential-source-of-methane-on-mars-1781070/?source">report</a>, researchers claim to have found data substantiating Curiosity’s initial methane detection. By scouring records from the ESO’s Mars Express satellite, the team found evidence that its probe had picked up the methane burst as well, confirming that Curiosity detected what we thought it had. More interestingly, we may also have found the source.</p>
<p><strong>Spoiler:</strong> It probably isn’t organically produced. Despite the fact that much of Earth’s methane is produced biologically, biological sources for Mars’ methane were always unlikely. If these findings are accurate, we can lay that idea to rest.
