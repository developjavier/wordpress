  How to watch this year’s Star Wars
  Celebration online
author: Jessica Goldberg
post_excerpt: |
  This week, Lucasfilm will hold its annual Star Wars Celebration, the official convention for the franchise.
  The company skipped holding a convention last year.
  It was last held in Orlando, Florida, in 2017.
  This year, it’ll be held in Chicago’s McCormick Place from April 11th–15th.
  We’re expecting to see quite a bit of Star Wars news come out of the convention this year, including a trailer for the upcoming Episode IX (and, presumably, something to call it other than “Episode IX”), a first look at The Mandalorian, a retrospective on Episode I: The Phantom Menace, the return of The Clone Wars on Disney+, and quite a bit more.
  If you aren’t in Chicago, you’ll still be able to follow along online: Lucasfilm will be streaming panels and hosting interviews throughout the weekend.
  You can check out the entire schedule here, but here are some of the highlights: Friday, April 12th Vader Immortal: A Star Wars VR Series: 1:30PM–2:30PM CT (2:30PM–3:30PM ET) Saturday, April 13th Bringing Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge to Life at Disney Parks, 11AM-12:30PM CT (12PM-1:30PM ET) Premiere of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order: 1:13PM–2:30PM CT (2:13PM–3:30PM ET) Sunday, April 14th Monday, April 15th
