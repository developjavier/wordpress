post_excerpt: |
  All dogs must be in a carrier/kennel, and ready to travel according to airport's and/or airline's rules and regulations.
  While more pet owners are bringing their dogs and cats with them onto the plane, a large chunk of that are also assistance dogs travelling as “support” or “service” animals for their owners.
  Are Dogs Allowed in Airports and Tips for Traveling with Your Pup Transportation of pets by plane is very stressful for the owners, and even more for the animals themselves.
  Different airports throughout the US have different rules when it comes to pets in general, and which breeds are allowed and when.
  Many airports have rules regarding emotional support animals that obligate owners to keep their animals in carriers, or to keep them on a short leash if they are too big to fit in a carrier.
  However, for any type of dog, there are steps to take in order to make the process go as smooth as possible.
  Also keep in mind that as stressful as the process might be for you, your dog has it worse.
  Prepare Your Pup Beforehand Get your pup to play with the carrier before the journey itself in order to reduce the stress of the flight.
  Try to tire him out a few hours before heading to the airport, because the chances are that he will be more cooperative and less nervous.
  Try to get to the airport early to avoid potential lines and to double-check if everything is in the right order.

<p><strong>Over the last few years, there</strong> has been a <a href="http://news.aa.com/news/news-details/2018/American-Airlines-Announces-Changes-to-Emotional-Support-Animal-Policy/default.aspx">40% increase</a> of animals being transported via airplanes, with the largest increase in 2018. It's not uncommon for people to travel with their pets, whether dog or cat, and more pet owners are now bringing their dogs and cats onto the plane rather than keeping them in the cargo hold, sedated, in a crate.</p>
<p><strong>So are dogs allowed in airports?</strong></p>
<p>No – for the most part, passengers cannot bring their dogs, leashed or unleashed, into the terminal (unless it's a service animal that the person needs and that's lawfully can be inside the building). All dogs must be in a carrier/kennel, and ready to travel according to airport's and/or airline's rules and regulations.</p>
<p>You've probably seen some leashed dogs outside of the kennel in the airport. While more pet owners are bringing their dogs and cats with them onto the plane, a large chunk of that are also <a href="https://topdogtips.com/different-types-of-assistance-dogs/">assistance dogs</a> travelling as “support” or “service” animals for their owners. While some of those are legitimate service animals, many are also transported under these labels simply to avoid ticketing.</p>
<p>Because of this, the number of animals present at airports has consequently increased throughout the country. Airports have to accommodate all these pets, which can occasionally be a daunting task. Considering the fact that many of these animals aren’t trained for the role that they are supposed to perform, dealing with them can get messy and even dangerous on occasion.</p>
<h2><strong>Are Dogs Allowed in Airports and Tips for Traveling with Your Pup</strong></h2>
<p>Transportation of pets by plane is very stressful for the owners, and even more for the animals themselves. Flying through the air is not a natural condition neither for people nor the animals. But for the animals, potential consequences are more difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Unlike a man who is aware of the change and is able to adapt to a new environment during the flight, dogs don’t understand what is expected of them and what they need to do during the flight. Plane flights are, without a doubt, very stressful for your pooch.</p>
<p>If you're preparing to fly with a dog, when it comes to airports, many factors must be taken into consideration. Different airports throughout the US have different rules when it comes to pets in general, and which breeds are allowed and when.</p>
<h3><strong>Unfortunate Occurrences</strong></h3>
<p>Last December, a <a href="https://www.koin.com/news/girl-5-bit-in-the-face-by-dog-injured-at-pdx/918053272">girl was bitten by a dog</a> on a Portland airport while waiting for her flight, because the dog wasn’t secured in a transport crate and was free to roam around. Similar cases have prompted more fierce regulations at US airports, and many of them are cutting down on the number of animals that are allowed to enter.</p>
