  Here’s how to do it: Step One: Check & Handle Your Dog’s Ears While most dogs aren’t thrilled with having their ears cleaned, you can make the entire process easier on you both by frequently handling your dog’s ears, not just when you’re preparing to clean them.
  During these random and frequent ear checks, if you notice any redness, discharge, swelling, foul odor, hair loss, flakey or scabby skin, or if your dog is pawing at his ears, shaking his head frequently, or showing signs of ear pain, do not attempt to clean his ears on your own.
  Step Two: Gather Your Supplies Now that your dog is accustomed to having her ears handled and you’ve checked for signs of infection, it’s time to get to cleaning!
  • Cotton balls or pads • Cotton-tipped swabs (Q-Tips): ONLY use cotton swabs to clean folds of the outer ear, NEVER inserting them into the ear canal.
  Step Three: Cleaning the Ears First, squeeze a few drops of ear cleaning solution into one ear.
  You may be able to hear the solution swishing around in your dog’s ear canal as you massage – that’s a good sign that the solution has reached the inner parts of the ear.
  After your dog shakes her head, squeeze enough cleaning solution onto a cotton ball or pad to saturate it.
  Use the solution-soaked cotton ball to wipe away any dirt or debris on the visible part of the dog’s ear.
  If your dog sits calmly for an ear cleaning, you may use cotton swabs soaked in solution to clean within the folds of the outer ear flap.
  However, some dogs with long, droopy, hairy, or floppy ears may need cleaned more often.

<p>Left unchecked, dirty ears can lead to excess wax buildup, painful irritation, dangerous infection, and eventual hearing loss. That’s why cleaning your dog’s ears is should be a regular part of your grooming and maintenance routine. Here’s how to do it:</p>
<p><strong>Step One: Check & Handle Your Dog’s Ears</strong></p>
<p>While most dogs aren’t thrilled with having their ears cleaned, you can make the entire process easier on you both by frequently handling your dog’s ears, not just when you’re preparing to clean them. When you’re petting your dog – and we know you pet him often – just take a second to touch his ears, lift an ear flap, look inside, give an “ear noogie” by rubbing the base of the ear with a circular motion, and then give your dog praise or treats. Perform this “ear check” often, not only to get your dog accustomed to having his ears handled, but also to check for any potential issues.</p>
<p>The inside of your dog’s ears should be free of dirt, debris, and waxy buildup. The skin should be healthy and free off any redness or inflammation. Any excess hair or mats should be carefully removed.</p>
<p>During these random and frequent ear checks, if you notice any redness, discharge, swelling, foul odor, hair loss, flakey or scabby skin, or if your dog is pawing at his ears, shaking his head frequently, or showing signs of ear pain, do not attempt to clean his ears on your own. Instead, schedule an immediate trip to your veterinarian.</p>
