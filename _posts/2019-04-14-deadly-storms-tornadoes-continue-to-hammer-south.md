  Wochit, Wochit A killer front that drove a line of severe storms and tornadoes through much of Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi was threatening the East Coast on Sunday with more wild, dangerous weather.
  The storms raced eastward on Saturday night and spawned several more tornadoes across Louisiana and Mississippi.
  Powerful storms that killed at least two people continued to move across the South on Sunday after spawning suspected tornadoes that left several people injured and multiple homes and businesses damaged or without power.
  Trees were down throughout the hilly city on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi.
  University spokesman Sid Salter said some debris, possibly carried by the tornado, was found on campus, but no injuries were reported and no buildings were damaged.
  Trees were down and at least some minor structural damage was reported in residential areas east of the campus.
  The weather service said the system is expected to shift to the Ohio Valley and the Southeast on Sunday.
  Some people had to be extricated from their homes.
  Winds of up to 60 mph were reported in Cherokee County, Texas, damaging two homes in Alto but not injuring anyone.
