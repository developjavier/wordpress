<p><strong>The temperatures are getting higher</strong>, and we're seeing sun in the sky more often now. Taking a walk with your pooch in the late spring or in summertime can be a very pleasant experience for both of you.

<p>Many pet owners assume that dogs being dogs, and coming from the wild, don't really need any protection, neither from the sun, rain, snow or other elements. That is, sadly, not true – and dogs can greatly benefit from protection, which ensures better skin, better health and longer lifespan.</p>
