  4 wireless providers announced their proposed merger on April 29, 2018.
  Makan Delrahim, head of the U.S. Justice Department’s Antitrust Division, said in a television interview that meetings were ongoing as regulators review the deal.
  “I have not made up my mind,” he told CNBC.
  “The investigation continues.
  We’ve requested some data from the companies that will be forthcoming.
  We don’t have a set number of meetings or a time line.” “If the case is there for us to challenge a transaction or suggest changes, we will do that,” he said.
  “We will make a decision collectively.
  My job is to make sure that the analysis is done properly, make sure that the facts are there.”
