  Cooling Mats, Pads and Beds Choosing between a cooling mat, pad or bed won’t make much difference since they are basically the same thing in the way they function and cool your dog.
  They are designed in a way that evenly distributes the cool air on all sides of the bed to provide the cooling effect.
  Water-filled – Water-filled cooling dog beds, mats and pads are a very popular option since water is a very effective cooling agent that's also cheap.
  These beds simply have to be filled with cool water and they will keep your dog chillier on a summer's day.
  When you choose the best cooling bed, mat or pad for your pooch, consider the effectiveness of the cooling process, comfort for the dog and durability.
  ALSO READ: The Best Dog Cooling Mats for Summer Cooling Vests/Harnesses Dog cooling vests use evaporation to keep your pooch cool, similar to the way humans sweat to get rid of excess body heat.
  You can also refrigerate the vest if you plan to go on a long walk, or simply pour more water on the vest if it dries out during the walk.
  As far as evaporation in cooling dog bandanas and dog collars go, they are just easy to use as cooling vests.
  For example, if you need something to keep your pooch cool at home, you should choose a cooling bed, mat or pad – this allows your pup to pick up a spot and cool off when resting.
  Another great way to provide your dog relief from summer's heat is with a dog pool.

<p><strong>The summer is close, and as</strong> much as high temperatures affect you, they can affect your pooch even harder. That’s why there are so many products out there that promise to keep your dog cool in the summer. We’ll take a look at some of those cooling dog supplies, their features and try to determine what’s best for your pooch.</p>
<h2><strong>Cooling Mats, Pads and Beds</strong></h2>
<p>Choosing between a cooling mat, pad or bed won’t make much difference since they are basically the same thing in the way they function and cool your dog. Even the manufacturers themselves often use these terms interchangeably.</p>
<p>While dog cooling mats and pads are almost <a href="https://topdogtips.com/how-a-dog-cooling-pad-works/">literally the same thing</a>, cooling beds are usually more comfortable (and more expensive) since they have thicker stuffing, except for elevated dog beds.</p>
<h4><strong>Types of Cooling Beds (Mats and Pads)</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Elevated beds</strong> – This is a unique type of cooling beds designed to be somewhat orthopedic as well, which makes them a good choice for dogs with joint, bone and muscle issues. They are designed in a way that evenly distributes the cool air on all sides of the bed to provide the cooling effect. Typically, there is no cooling gel and they aren't powered by electricity to emit cooling effects; instead, they simply allow for better ventilation and as the dog rests above ground, it's easier for them to cool off.</p>
<p><strong>Water-filled</strong> – Water-filled cooling dog beds, mats and pads are a very popular option since water is a very effective cooling agent that's also cheap. These beds simply have to be filled with cool water and they will keep your dog chillier on a summer's day. Some of them require replacing the water occasionally, others don’t. They are more effective at cooling than elevated beds, but they do have a drawback – these beds can often leak or spill and they are not the best choice for dogs who like to chew on things. They can also grow mildew sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>Gel-filled</strong> – Dog cooling beds, mats and pads that are filled with a special cooling gel are mostly activated by pressure as the dog lies down on it, although some of them use phase-changing materials which allow them to stay cool longer. These beds usually take in a dog’s weight and absorb his temperature to cool the dog down. Usually, gel-filled beds are most expensive but also most effective among the three.</p>
<p>When you choose the best cooling bed, mat or pad for your pooch, consider the effectiveness of the cooling process, comfort for the dog and durability.</p>
