  Setting Up a Proper Feeding Station for
  Your Dog
author: Jessica Goldberg
post_excerpt: |
  Many pet parents mistakenly believe that any old food or water bowl will suffice when feeding their dog.
  Selecting the right dish, feeder, or fountain can help slow a dog that eats too fast, provide a proper feeding schedule to one on a restrictive diet, or encourage a dog to drink healthy amounts of water when they otherwise may not get enough.
  Consider the following when setting up a proper feeding station for your unique dog: Food & Water Dishes When shopping for food and water dishes, think about the type of dog you have, the diet he or she eats, and any issues you’re hoping to overcome.
  Dogs that are especially sloppy (and their owners) will benefit from a spill-proof dog dish, like the Neater Feeder.
  And, large or senior dogs that can’t bend as easily will benefit from an elevated dish.
  Feeders work by holding a large quantity of food in a gravity-fed reservoir and releasing the food into a bowl as the dog eats.
  While these feeders make it easy to provide access to food at all times, a gravity feeder may not be the best option for all pets, especially those that tend to eat until the food is gone, not until they feel full.
  For better control over the quantity of food your dog eats and the times of day he’s fed, opt instead for an automatic feeder.
  Automatic feeders allow you to program several measured feedings throughout the day, at scheduled times, making them an excellent tool for pet parents that are away from home, but want to provide several healthy meals throughout the day.
  A pet water fountain is the best way to provide the fresh water your dog prefers, particularly if you use local city or well water.

<p>Many pet parents mistakenly believe that any old food or water bowl will suffice when feeding their dog. Truth is, the assortment of dishes and feeders available is as vast and varied as the assortment of dogs – and the right dish for one dog could be totally wrong for another.</p>
<p>When dog owners choose a dish based on how nice it will look in the kitchen as opposed to how well it meets their dog’s needs, they’re actually doing their dog a disservice. Selecting the right dish, feeder, or fountain can help slow a dog that eats too fast, provide a proper feeding schedule to one on a restrictive diet, or encourage a dog to drink healthy amounts of water when they otherwise may not get enough.</p>

<p>When shopping for food and water dishes, think about the type of dog you have, the diet he or she eats, and any issues you’re hoping to overcome. Many pet parents don’t realize that different dogs actually require different bowls. While short-nosed breeds will benefit from a shallow dish, long-eared dogs will avoid dragging their ears through their food with a deeper dish, and an older dog may benefit from an elevated diner that relieves pressure on their joints when bending down to eat.</p>
<p>In addition to selecting the right style dish, different types of food will be better served in bowls made of different materials. While a stainless steel dish is a great all-around option for a variety of foods, a plastic bowl or one made of a porous material like ceramic may not be appropriate for raw or canned food as they can break down over time, becoming more difficult to...</p> <p class="article-info-more"> <a href="https://www.dogingtonpost.com/setting-up-a-proper-feeding-station-for-your-dog/" target="_blank">Click here to read more</a> </p>
