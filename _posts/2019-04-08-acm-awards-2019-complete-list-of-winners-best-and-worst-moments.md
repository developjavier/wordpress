  Country duo Dan + Shay continued their career-making year at the 2019 Academy of Country Music Awards on Sunday, as they won three awards — the most of any act — and became the night’s running joke.
  * Blake Shelton’s unexpectedly dark sound.
  Speaking of singers trying new things, you don’t usually think “party song” and “Carrie Underwood.” Usually, her singles revolve around “love” or “vengeance” or “murder.” So props to her for going in the complete opposite direction with “Southbound,” an upbeat, spring break-themed track that started at a Vegas pool (joined by her tour openers, Maddie & Tae and Runaway June) and continued into the ACMs venue, with lots of backup dancers who looked thrilled to be there.
  Although the ACMs gushed about how Lambert has the most ACM awards in the history of the show (32!
  Jason Aldean Luke Bryan Kenny Chesney Chris Stapleton Keith Urban — winner
  Miranda Lambert Ashley McBryde Maren Morris Kacey Musgraves — winner Carrie Underwood
  Dierks Bentley Luke Combs Thomas Rhett — winner Chris Stapleton Keith Urban
  Brothers Osborne Dan + Shay — winner Florida Georgia Line
  “Dan + Shay” Dan + Shay “Desperate Man” Eric Church “From A Room: Volume 2” Chris Stapleton “Golden Hour” Kacey Musgraves — winner “The Mountain” Dierks Bentley
  Florida Georgia Line “Most People Are Good” Luke Bryan “Tequila” Dan + Shay — winner

<p class="article-info-author-source"> <span>Author: Emily Yahr</span>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<span>Source: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/04/08/acm-awards-complete-list-winners-best-worst-moments/?noredirect=on" target="_blank">Washington Post</a></span> </p> <p>Country duo Dan + Shay continued their <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/country/8490483/dan-and-shay-2018-recap-interview">career-making year</a> at the 2019 Academy of Country Music Awards on Sunday, as they won three awards <i>—</i> the most of any act <i>—</i> and became the night’s running joke.</p>
<p>“I’m gonna give this to Dan + Shay so they can go home with four,” Thomas Rhett declared when he picked up the trophy for male artist of the year. Host Reba McEntire said that the show should be renamed “Dan + Shay’s Excellent Adventure.”</p>
<p>Even Dan Smyers and Shay Mooney themselves, clearly overwhelmed, were self-deprecating by the time they gave their third speech. “I think somebody got the cards mixed up,” Smyers deadpanned as they accepted the award for vocal duo. They also walked away with song and single of the year for the ballad “Tequila,” the smash that earned them their first Grammy for duo/group performance.</p>

<p>Kacey Musgraves continued her winning streak with “Golden Hour,” which <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/02/11/how-kacey-musgraves-grammy-album-year-winner-broke-through-country-music-bubble/?utm_term=.6e827b1d15b4">propelled her to four Grammys</a> in February, including album of the year. This time, she won for ACM album and female artist of the year; and though she curiously did not get a performance slot on the three-hour telecast, she made the most of her time onstage with an empowering message.</p>
<p>“This award goes out to any woman, or girl <i>—</i> or anybody, really <i>—</i> that is maybe being told that her perspective or her style is too different to work,” said Musgraves, perhaps in a nod to the fact that some country music gatekeepers <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/11/kacey-musgraves-cma-win">don’t appreciate</a> her unique perspective. “Just stay at it. It’ll work out.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Keith Urban triumphed in the coveted entertainer of the year category, and became emotional as he thanked his wife, Nicole Kidman (beaming in the audience, as usual), and their two daughters. A complete list of winners is below; here are some of the best and worst moments from the show.</p>
<p><u><b>BEST</b></u></p>
<p><b>* Ashley McBryde’s moment of triumph with ‘Girl Goin’ Nowhere.’</b></p>
<p>McBryde, who barely scraped out a living for a decade in Nashville before she released her <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/03/30/remember-the-name-ashley-mcbryde-because-after-a-decade-nashville-is-finally-paying-attention/?utm_term=.baa444907bc1">critically acclaimed debut album</a> last year, had one of those moments that artists only dream about: She got to go on national television and sing a song about people who thought she would never make it. Specifically, the stunning acoustic ballad “Girl Goin’ Nowhere,” inspired by a teacher who told her she would never be a country singer.</p>
<p>At the end of the performance, McBryde (who won new female artist of the year) was so choked up she could barely sing. “Wow,” she said, as the audience gave her a thunderous standing ovation.</p>

<p><b>* The Maren Morris and Brothers Osborne collaboration.</b></p>
<p>Some ACM performances were deeply solemn, while others radiated pure infectious joy <i>—</i> Morris and T.J. and John Osborne were definitely the latter. The three singers (who are close friends in real life) had a blast with their new song “All My Favorite People,” a cut off <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/maren-morris-has-the-best-voice-in-country-music-shes-still-learning-how-to-use-it/2019/03/08/be77d5be-41c7-11e9-922c-64d6b7840b82_story.html?utm_term=.6e35e2d3f261">Morris’s new album, “Girl.”</a> The performance had some Nashville inside jokes, including a sign for Santa’s Pub, one of Music City’s favorite dive bars with epic karaoke.</p>

<p><b>* The many other duets.</b></p>
<p>Typically, country award show duets are hit or miss, but this year had a surprising number of solid pairings. Kane Brown and Khalid impressed with a remixed version of “Saturday Nights,” which Khalid rereleased in January. Dierks Bentley and Brandi Carlile brought down the house with “Travelin’ Light,” which appears on Bentley’s album. Eric Church and McBryde’s blended perfectly together on <a href="https://tasteofcountry.com/eric-church-the-snake/">his song “The Snake,”</a> about the current poisonous political atmosphere.</p>
