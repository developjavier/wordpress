  The courts are often extremely stressful, not only for owners, but for dogs, too.
  Dogs have adapted over the centuries to intuit the feelings of their owners.
  If you’re willing to give up the dog, you’ll have leverage to demand your partner compromise on other things – like the television or curtains.
  Find an Understanding Lawyer Dogs aren’t quite like any other animal.
  In centuries past, they were valued workers, whose sheep-herding, bird-chasing, and vermin-hunting efforts were highly prized.
  If your lawyer is not a dog person, or hates dogs, then they probably won’t understand why you’re getting so worked up over the possibility of losing yours.
  In such cases, you might prefer to find another lawyer – one who understands exactly what’s at stake, and who’ll fight tooth-and-nail on your behalf.
  Consider Co-parenting In some cases, you may decide that it’s best to share custody of the dog.
  Secondly, you’ll need to consider whether your personal circumstances suit the needs of the dog.
  The family dog can, for many couples, be the most important point of any divorce.

<p class="article-info-author-source"> <span>Author: Guest Author</span>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<span>Source: <a href="https://www.dogingtonpost.com/getting-divorced-who-gets-the-dog/" target="_blank">The Dogington Post</a></span> </p> <p>Divorce is often a cutthroat business – and when a much-loved family pet is at stake, things can get even more fractious. A <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/pets/10562375/Take-the-kids-but-Ill-fight-you-for-the-dog.html">2014 survey</a> found that around a fifth of divorcees consider custody of the dog to be ‘as stressful’ as that of the children. Even if you aren’t quite as impassioned as that, it’s worth considering how to decide who gets the dog – ideally before you get hitched in the first place.</p>

<figcaption>We’ve distilled the process down into four key steps. Let’s take a look!</figcaption>

<p><strong>Keep it Out of Court</strong></p>
<p>In most cases, this sort of dispute can resolved before it reaches the court. In many households, it might be obvious who the dog will be better off with. Moreover, formal proceedings will demand legal expertise, which will add to the cost of your divorce.</p>
<p>The courts are often extremely stressful, not only for owners, but for dogs, too. Dogs have adapted over the centuries to intuit the feelings of their owners. When you’re happy, they tend to feel happy; when you’re miserable, they feel the same way. As such, the stress of these legal battles is going to take a toll on them as much as you.</p>
<p>Your lawyer will almost always advise that you settle your dog-related disagreements out of court. If you’re willing to give up the dog, you’ll have leverage to demand your partner compromise on other things – like the television or curtains.</p>
<p>If there are two dogs involved, then taking one apiece might seem an egalitarian option. However, dogs which have grown up together might suffer avoidable stress if they’re split up (which is why many shelters will seek to give away certain dogs only as a pair). This should therefore be avoided for the sake of the dog’s welfare.</p>
<p><strong>Find an Understanding Lawyer</strong></p>
<p>Dogs aren’t quite like any other animal. In centuries past, they were valued workers, whose sheep-herding, bird-chasing, and vermin-hunting efforts were highly prized. They form incredibly strong bonds with the human beings who care for them – and it’s through this relationship that they’ve thrived.</p>
