  Israeli exit polls are just as
  unreliable as American ones

  As polls get set to close in Israel with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu facing a tight reelection battle, keep in mind that Israeli exit polls are just as unreliable as American ones.
  Voting stations will close at 3 p.m. Eastern time, and the early exits are expected to drip out around then.
  In 2015, polls predicted Netanyahu was a goner, and then, early exits showed his Likud party more or less tied with the liberal Zionist Union party.
  To become prime minister, an Israeli politician has to be able to put together a coalition that adds up to a majority of 61 seats in the parliament, or Knesset.
  So what everybody is waiting to see tonight is not just how well the two top parties did (this time, it will be Likud and the centrist Blue and White), but ultimately whether the right-wing bloc or left-win bloc ended up with more support collectively.
  Further complicating matters is that for a party to get any seats, it has to meet the threshold of winning at least four.
  Anything below that amount and those votes essentially get discounted, and the seats get apportioned among the parties that did meet the threshold.
  There are 39 parties running this time around, of which 14 are expected to make it into the Knesset.
  Given how the parties on the bubble can have a big impact depending on whether they get just above the threshold or below the threshold, it's difficult to tell where things will end up until the votes have been counted.
  At that point, the horse trading begins to woo the smaller parties into a coalition, which could take days or even weeks.
