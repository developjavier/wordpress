  Playing this modified game of fetch will give you much more exercise than sitting in the lounge chair letting your dog do all the work!
  One way to get moving and practice training a vital dog skill is Hide and Seek.
  This is a great way for groups of two or more to enjoy a game with your dog.
  When he comes, give him a treat and some praise.
  Remember to use plenty of praise, small food rewards, and encouragement when your dog successfully navigates each obstacle.
  Keep the tone fun and avoid correcting your dog while playing this fun game.
  You will both look forward to weekly training sessions, road trips for competitions, and meeting lots of other fun people who enjoy the company of our furry friends.
  Here are two very popular options: Flyball Flyball is a fast paced team sport which involves a 4 dog relay race over jumps to retrieve a ball in timed trials.
  This outdoor obstacle course is one of the more demanding dog sports on handlers who have to run nearly as much as the dogs!
  Although this dog sport has one of the higher learning curves in the dog sport world, for many it is the beginning of a lifelong active passion that gives them a new way to enjoy the outdoors with their dog.

<p>One way to get moving and practice training a vital dog skill is Hide and Seek. This is a great way for groups of two or more to enjoy a game with your dog. (Think play date.) It has the add benefit of reinforcing your pooch’s skills at coming when called, a vital skill in an emergency.</p>
<p>Give everyone a small bag of treats, or even just a handful of dog kibbe. Everyone should find a spot to be just out of sight, then call the dog by name in a fun and excited tone. When he comes, give him a treat and some praise. Take turns, hiding in a new spot after your turn.</p>
