<p><strong>Did you know that spinal problems in dogs</strong> are more common than most owners realize? Typically, these issues take some time to develop before the symptoms become apparent and your pup's behavior clearly changes, but when they do, they can seriously impact your dog’s quality of life. We’ll take a look at the most common signs of spine problems in dogs and what you can do to prevent and fix these issues.</p>
<h2><strong>Symptoms of Spinal Problems in Dogs</strong></h2>
<p>There are many different signs of spinal problems in dogs, mainly depending on the cause and the severity of the condition. Some of the most common signs are below.</p>
<h4><strong>Inability to Move Naturally</strong></h4>
<p>The easiest way to spot spinal problems in your dog is by paying attention to pet's posture and movement, like rear limb weakness and indication of pain, which you may notice if your pup has trouble climbing stairs or <a href="https://topdogtips.com/how-to-help-a-dog-get-into-a-vehicle/">getting into a car</a>. He may even start to drag his rear legs, which is often accompanied by tail dropping and hunched back.</p>
<p>Other signs include problems with lying down or getting up, unwillingness to move or jump, and limping.</p>
<h4><strong>Signs of Pain</strong></h4>
<p>While some cases of dog spine problems can be painless for the dog, mostly they are accompanied by some type of pain or stiffness in the dog’s back or neck. When the pain becomes too strong, dogs usually cry out or vocalize their pain in other ways.</p>
<h4><strong>Neurological Problems</strong></h4>
<p><a href="https://topdogtips.com/neurological-problems-in-dogs/">Neurological problems</a> related to spine conditions in dogs include loss of balance and coordination, loss of muscle mass and <a href="https://topdogtips.com/dog-muscle-spasms/">muscle spasms</a> over the dog’s back and neck, and complete <a href="https://topdogtips.com/muscle-atrophy-in-dogs/">muscle atrophy</a>. In some extreme cases even the inability to feel pain or paralysis can occur.</p>
<p>Loss of bowel or bladder control, also called incontinence, can be a sign of dog spinal problems as well.</p>
<h4><strong>Other Sings</strong></h4>
<p>You may notice some changes in your dog’s behavior, particularly see the dog develop a more anxious behavior and become sensitive to movement and even noises, reduced activity level and decreased appetite. Rapid breathing and shivering can also suggest spinal problems, and levels of stress in the dog can also be clearly observed.</p>
<h2><strong>Causes of Dog Spine Problems</strong></h2>
<p>There are many potential causes of spine problems in dogs. Some are neurological, others come as a result of inflammation and a few of them are caused by viral, bacterial and fungal infections. We will focus on the most common ones, and on the ways to prevent and treat dog spine problems whenever possible.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Trauma/Injury</strong></h3>
<p>The most common cause of spinal problems in dogs is trauma. The trauma can be caused by a fall or an accident, although the more common causes include everyday activities like jumping for balls and particularly bad posture. Spinal cord <a href="https://topdogtips.com/prevent-injuries-in-dogs/">injuries</a> mostly occur as a result of a spinal dislocation or fraction.</p>
<p>However, the injury doesn’t have to be recent. The origin of the spinal problem can happen years before symptoms show up. Symptoms of spinal trauma in the dog usually show up suddenly and can be severe and worsen progressively.</p>
<h4><strong>How to Prevent It:</strong></h4>
<p>There is no single way to prevent any kind of injuries in dogs. Keep your pooch safe from traffic and cars since car accidents are one of the leading causes of injuries in dogs. Whenever playing or training with your dog, practice safety and be cautious.</p>
<p>Other than that, ensure that your pup has the right posture and don’t work him too hard during exercise or play. Sometimes dogs do not realize when they're overworked, and you'll have to do this guess work for them.</p>
<h4><strong>How to Fix It:</strong></h4>
<p>If you notice that your canine is limping or shows any other signs of spinal problems, take him to the vet immediately. Your vet will notice any fractures or dislocations on x-rays or CT scan, if the pet's problems are caused by trauma or injury.</p>
<p>The most common way to treat traumas in dogs is with <a href="https://topdogtips.com/pain-management-for-dogs/">pain medication</a> and proper rest. However, some types of injuries require surgery.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Inflammatory and Infectious Diseases</strong></h3>
<p>Infectious and inflammatory diseases <a href="https://www.merckvetmanual.com/dog-owners/brain,-spinal-cord,-and-nerve-disorders-of-dogs/disorders-of-the-spinal-column-and-cord-in-dogs">of the spine</a> include viral, protozoal, fungal, bacterial and parasitic infections, as well as inflammation caused by unknown reasons. Most of these diseases are neurological in nature, which means they affect the dog’s brain as well. Some of the more common diseases include canine distemper, rabies, rickettsial disease and verminous myelitis.</p>
<h4><strong>How to Prevent It:</strong></h4>
<p>Prevention of the infectious diseases in dogs consists of making sure that your pooch always...</p> <p class="article-info-more"> <a href="https://topdogtips.com/dog-spine-problems/" target="_blank">Click here to read more</a> </p>
