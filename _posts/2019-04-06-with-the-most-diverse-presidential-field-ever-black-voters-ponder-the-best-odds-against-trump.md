  With the most diverse presidential field
  ever, black voters ponder the best odds
  against Trump

  NEW YORK — More than a third of the candidates seeking the Democratic nomination for president are women.
  The rise of Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), ex-congressman Beto O’Rourke and former vice president Joe Biden in a field with historic diversity has caused dismay among some Democrats, particularly African Americans and women hoping for a mold-breaking nominee who reflects the changing face of the party and the country.
  Black voters, particularly black women, have the potential to play a decisive role in the Democratic Party’s attempt to defeat President Trump in 2020.
  They are opening the door to reparations, speaking openly about the legacy of slavery and offering blunt talk on racial injustice — a stark departure from past presidential campaigns in which candidates trod lightly around those topics.
  For many people, Clark said, “there is still this comfort level with what we’ve had for all but one president — and that is a white man.” She cheered Abrams during a Wednesday speech that electrified a heavily black audience at the National Action Network (NAN) gathering.
  Biden, who did not speak in New York, has signaled he will run for president but has not announced a decision.
  Harris came in second among candidates who have released fundraising tallies so far, raising $12 million over a longer period than either O’Rourke or Sanders was in the race.
  Many Democrats attribute his early success — and that of O’Rourke and Sanders — to establishing a national following in previous campaigns, but they said that’s no guarantee of victory this time.
  “That’s the American norm; people vote for what they know.
  Biden is 76, and Sanders is 77.

<p>NEW YORK — More than a third of the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/politics/2020-presidential-hopefuls/?utm_term=.8583149daa98">candidates</a> seeking the Democratic nomination for president are women. There are two black men, a Mexican American man, a Taiwanese American man and a gay man.</p>
<p>Yet, in the initial phase of the 2020 race, two straight white men have emerged as the fastest fundraisers, and another has jumped to a lead in recent polls, before even announcing his candidacy.</p>
<p>The rise of Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), ex-congressman Beto O’Rourke and former vice president Joe Biden in a field with historic diversity has caused dismay among some Democrats, particularly African Americans and women hoping for a mold-breaking nominee who reflects the changing face of the party and the country.</p>
<p>Black voters, particularly black women, have the potential to play a decisive role in the Democratic Party’s attempt to defeat President Trump in 2020. An inability to earn their support has dealt severe blows to past candidates — most recently Sanders in the 2016 primaries and to a lesser extent Hillary Clinton in the general election.</p>
<p>That has led the current white male candidates in particular to seek out black voters with some urgency. They are opening the door to reparations, speaking openly about the legacy of slavery and offering blunt talk on racial injustice — a stark departure from past presidential campaigns in which candidates trod lightly around those topics.</p>
<p>As 11 presidential hopefuls appeared this week at a Midtown Manhattan hotel for the National Action Network convention, frustration emerged over the standing of the nonwhite candidates. But there was also tension between some black voters who want a candidate reflecting the nation’s diversity and others who perceive the white men as potentially stronger against Trump.</p>
<p>“Because I am a black woman, I want to see a black woman for president. And not just because she’s a black woman, but we have some excellent candidates,” said Lovelle Clark, a 65-year-old New Yorker who named Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) and potentially Stacey Abrams, who narrowly lost a race for governor of Georgia last year. For many people, Clark said, “there is still this comfort level with what we’ve had for all but one president — and that is a white man.”</p>
<p>She cheered Abrams during a Wednesday speech that electrified a heavily black audience at the National Action Network (NAN) gathering. The address culminated in chants of “Run, Stacey, run!” as Abrams left the door open to a White House bid.</p>
<p>Other Democrats said they view Biden, O’Rourke and Sanders as credible and compelling contenders best equipped to defeat Trump. The conflicting opinions revealed Democratic divisions touching on race, gender and identity that could shape the nomination fight.</p>
<p>“The old white guys have been in the political arena. They know what the job entails,” said Yvonne James, a 79-year-old New Yorker who carried a canvas bag at the convention with images of the Obamas and other “strong black men and women” stitched onto it. “So if it boils down to them or somebody who’s kind of new, let’s go with the experienced choice.”</p>
<p>In their speeches, the candidates spoke of criminal justice reform, economic disparities between blacks and whites, and the need to protect voting rights. They also endorsed a plan to create a commission to study reparations for descendants of slaves, a topic that NAN founder Al Sharpton pressed them on and that many attendees strongly favored.</p>
