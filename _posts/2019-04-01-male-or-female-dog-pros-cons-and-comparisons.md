  Will a male or female dog make a better family pet?
  Do male and female dogs have more or less aggressive personalities?
  What matters much more than whether your new pet dog is male or female is: the temperament of each parent dog how well your new puppy has been pre-socialized within the litter your own use of positive training and reinforcement your efforts to choose a dog breed that is a good match for your interests and lifestyle.
  Shorter dog breeds showed more overall aggression.
  Yet another research study surveyed 15,000 dog owners to determine major triggers for aggressive canine behavior.
  If your plans for your new pup include K-9, service work or competitions, two same-gender dogs together can impair each dog’s ability to train well and do their work to full potential.
  If you want a highly trainable dog, be sure to research temperament and pick a dog that scores high in trainability intelligence and a trait called “people-pleasing.” Male vs Female Dog Exercise In some dog breeds, adult males may be slightly stockier, heavier or taller than adult females.
  Far more important determinants of exercise needs include your dog’s breed and age.
  Male vs Female Dog Health Male and female dogs, like male and female people, have some health issues in common and others that are specific to gender.
  This means if a nearby female dog is in heat and your male dog is not fixed, be prepared for a very rambunctious male dog.

<p>Will a male or female dog make a better family pet?</p>
<p>Is a male or female dog more likely to excel at canine sports or in show competitions?</p>
<p>Do male and female dogs have more or less aggressive personalities?</p>
<p>If there is one topic within the world of companion canines that can provoke strong personal opinions, it is this one.</p>
<p>In this article, we take a close look at what recent research says about whether a male or female dog is the better pick for you.</p>
<h2>Male or Female Dog: Does It Even Matter?</h2>
<p>Does it matter if your dog is male or female? The most accurate answer is “it depends.”</p>
<p>For example, if you are adding a new dog to your family and you already have one or more pet dogs, the gender of the new dog can matter quite a bit.</p>
<p>As long as both dogs are fixed (spay/neuter), choosing a new dog of the opposite gender from your existing dog is recommended.</p>
<p>There is somewhat of a natural inhibition in dogs against aggression toward the opposite gender.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this holds true regardless of whether the two opposite-gender dogs are the same breed or not.</p>
<p>Research suggests that many people will automatically think all girl dogs are “sweet” and all boy dogs are “aggressive.”</p>
<p>This is not only inaccurate but can be a dangerous assumption.</p>
<p>Research shows that female dogs are often more territorial, more aggressive in fights and more likely to start fights.</p>
<p>This behavior appears when their status is threatened, especially by another female dog.</p>
<p>As well, a pregnant female dog or one caring for a litter of puppies can be both aggressive and unpredictable if she feels her pups are being threatened.</p>
<p>There is also a type of medical “phantom aggression” triggered by hormones that unfixed female dogs can display even if they are not pregnant or in heat.</p>
<p>What matters much more than whether your new pet dog is male or female is:</p>
<ul>
<li>the temperament of each parent dog</li>
<li>how well your new puppy has been pre-socialized within the litter</li>
<li>your own use of positive training and reinforcement</li>
<li>your efforts to choose a dog breed that is a good match for your interests and lifestyle.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Male vs Female Dog Appearance</h2>
<p>Some dog breeds have quite distinctive appearance changes based on gender, which is called sexual dimorphism.</p>
<p>Other dog breeds display monomorphism to a greater degree, which means males and females look very similar into adulthood.</p>
<p>One research study analyzed 80 different purebred dog breeds for sexual dimorphism in head length, width and ratio of head length to width.</p>
<ul>
<li>Five dog breeds had gender-based differences in head length only.</li>
<li>Ten dog breeds showed the same in head length only. Two dog breeds showed a difference in ratio only.</li>
<li>The other dog breeds showed no measurable appearance differences related to gender in these three areas.</li>
</ul>
<p>One area where more dog breeds do reliably show gender-based appearance differences is in sheer size, height and weight.</p>
<p>Fully grown male dogs (whether neutered or intact) are often taller, heavier and stockier than their adult female counterparts.</p>
<p>This appearance difference is also one of the very few that can start as early as puppyhood.</p>
<p>The earlier a puppy is fixed, however, the less prominent these differences tend to be.</p>
<h2>Is a Male or Female Dog Friendlier?</h2>
<p>Many people automatically associate female dogs with friendlier temperaments.</p>
<p>Research now suggests that there may be much more important determinants than gender in predicting temperament.</p>
<p>Specifically, more than 67,000 dogs were analyzed for a range of behavioral and temperament traits based on their head shape, body weight and overall size.</p>
<p>Shorter dog breeds showed more overall aggression.</p>
<p>Taller dog breeds showed more overall affection and cooperation.</p>
<p>Heavyweight dogs displayed bolder behavior, including curiosity and attentiveness.</p>
<p>Lighter-weight dogs were more tentative and prone to displays of fear.</p>
<p>Dogs with very short muzzles (brachycephalic) were generally more owner-engaged during play and also more fearful in strange situations.</p>
<p>Dogs with longer muzzles were less engaged in owner-dog playtime but were also calmer in unfamiliar scenarios.</p>
<p>Yet another research study surveyed 15,000 dog owners to determine major triggers for aggressive canine behavior.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, data showed that owners have a great deal of influence over whether a dog becomes aggressive or not—regardless of the dog’s gender.</p>
