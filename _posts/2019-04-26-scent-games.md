  I’ve written before about the importance of letting dogs use their noses in Take Your Dog on A Sniff, and I’m not alone in my belief that dogs need to use their sense of smell to be truly happy.
  Play Find It: It’s easy to teach dogs to use their noses to search for something.
  My favorite variant is in Suzanne Clothier’s great article on Scent Games for dogs.
  Say Find It as you walk back searching for it.
  Play Find Me!
  It’s come in handy for more than just games, because I’ll use it as a distraction when I need to refocus Willie’s attention.
  I just said “Find Jim” and he left me and said vacuum alone and went to find his favorite guy.
  Tonight I’m going to play the Klutz game (Jim might say I do that all the time), and drop my glove on our walk.
  Your favorite scent game?
  But here’s the good side, from a walk the BCs and I took after it had snowed enough on top of the ice to make it walkable.

<p><strong>Ah, poopsicles,</strong> my current competition for Willie and Maggie’s attention. It’s too bad that their primary outdoor object of interest is, well, poop, because searching for something in knee deep snow is a great way to keep dogs entertained. (Luckily, we have a vast armory of treats that make it easy to reinforce our Recall or Leave It cue, and avoid being licked by dog whose breath smells like a sewer. We just have to watch them like hawks.)</p>
<p><strong>But watching Maggie plunge her nose</strong> into the snow, a nose that could clear a 200 acre dog park of poop in an hour, no matter how deeply buried in snow, reminds me how important scent is to dogs. Not to mention how snowy winters give dogs less opportunity to use their noses. And this is an opportunity that feels especially important to me right now, because 1) It’s too slippery to work the dogs on sheep except for the simplest and most essential of chores, 2) It’s been too slippery to let the dogs play much outside at all, and 3) It’s too cold and icy and snowy to exist without wondering why you live in a freezer compartment that keeps getting defrosted, then refrozen, then defrosted, then refrozen. . .</p>
<p><strong>Oh, wait, sorry.</strong> Got distracted.</p>
<p><strong>I’ve written before</strong> about the importance of letting dogs use their noses in <a href="https://www.patriciamcconnell.com/theotherendoftheleash/take-your-dog-on-a-sniff"><strong>Take Your Dog on A Sniff</strong></a>, and I’m not alone in my belief that dogs need to use their sense of smell to be truly happy. Marc Bekoff just posted a good read on the topic in <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/animal-emotions/201902/allowing-dogs-sniff-helps-them-think-positively?eml"><strong>Psychology Today</strong></a><strong>,</strong> and <a href="https://www.companionanimalpsychology.com/"><strong>Companion Animal Psychology</strong></a> posted about <strong>the same</strong> <a href="https://www.companionanimalpsychology.com/2019/02/finding-hidden-food-in-nosework.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+CompanionAnimalPsychology+%28Companion+Animal+Psychology+by+Zazie+Todd+PhD%29"><strong>study by Duranton and Horowitz</strong></a> that suggests dogs who use their noses are more optimistic than others. (I am not convinced of the author’s conclusion however, but my logic requires more space than I have here. Perhaps for another blog, or in the comment section for those who read the study?) <strong>Alexandra Horowitz</strong> wrote her fantastic book, <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Being-a-Dog/Alexandra-Horowitz/9781476796024"><strong><em>Being a Dog,</em></strong></a> about scent as the center of a dog’s world view. Susannah Charleson and Cat Warren wrote two of my favorite dog book/memoirs, <a href="http://susannahcharleson.com/bio/#!/books"><strong><em>Scent of the Missing</em></strong></a> and <a href="http://catwarren.com/the-book"><strong><em>What the Dog Knows</em></strong></a> — about dogs using their remarkable sense of smell to locate missing persons or their bodies.</p>
<p><strong>But what are we nose-challenged primates</strong> to do about our dog’s need to use its nose to explore the world when it’s covered in a blanket of ice and snow? Here are but a few ideas to allow them to do that.</p>

<p><strong>Check out some resources:</strong> Dogwise has an entire section on books related to <a href="https://www.dogwise.com/canine-dog-nosework-books"><strong>Nose work for Dogs</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Play Find It:</strong> It’s easy to teach dogs to use their noses to search for something. Just start by putting something a few feet away that you know they love and saying Find It. Gradually put the object (dogs on stay of course) farther and farther away, eventually completely out of sight. Initially lots of dogs will use their eyes to find the toy, but most quickly learn to use their noses. It’s great fun to watch them do it, and a window into a world that most of us primates don’t get to enjoy. There are lots of variants to this game, including laying a scent trail (scented pieces of paper for example) leading to a tennis ball with the same scent. Basically you’re teaching your dog to learn to track, which is much of what they use their noses for on...</p> <p class="article-info-more"> <a href="https://www.patriciamcconnell.com/theotherendoftheleash/scent-games" target="_blank">Click here to read more</a> </p>
